" The Roots of Krip-Hop Nation Rob,  Keith & Leroy : von koka | Apr 8, 2021 | Blog | 0 Kommentare  Krip-Hop Nation started with Leroy Moore, Rob DA Noize Temple and Keith Jones in 2007. I first  met Rob face to face in his home studio in Brooklyn, NY. and we produced our first Krip-Hop  song entitled, Krip-Hop. After we recorded the song, we talked about what will be Krip-Hop  Nation. Rob told me about all the discrimination he faced in the music industry. He said. Krip- Hop Nation was like finally coming home. Before that first face to face meeting, we met online  when I saw Rob’s statement on a musician’s website where he wrote a statement like call out to  other disabled musicians to come together. So I emailed him and told him what I had in mind  aka Krip-Hop Nation and this was early 2000 before I was apart of the creation of a three part  radio series on disabled/Deaf Hip-Hop artists in 2006 at a radio station here in Berkeley, CA  KPFA. : ",music,discrimination,disabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Roots of Krip-Hop Nation Rob,  Keith & Leroy : In 2004 I met the second co-founder of Krip-Hop Nation face to face after years communicating  on MySpace at that time, there were no Facebook at that time. Keith Jones and I met when I was  delegate at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, MA in the Fall. We were planning to  go to the Disability Caucus at the DNC with other Black disabled local activists. After almost  getting kicked out of the DNC, we ended up in a local recording studio dropping Keith Jones aka  Fezo DA MadOne second CD. During the studio time and at the DNC we talked about Krip-Hop  Nation and like Rob DA Noize Temple, Keith had stories of being discriminated against from  record labels because of his disability. Keith loved the idea of Krip-Hop Nation when we met  face to face back in 2004.  ",history,disability,Black,discrimination,music,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
