" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : activists and artists making change in 2016  In 2016 we commiserated. We ate cubes of cheese at all the art  things and sighed about the year, hopefully whispering about 2017.  At the time of writing, I am holding my breath for these last few days  of 2016, hoping to make it into 2017 with only a few more kicks in the  teeth — or in light of my recent kidney infection, the kidneys.:  It's hard to reflect back on a year such as this one — but when I do I  realize that despite it all, we have survived. And for me, this survival  is in large part due to the ""black crip magic"": the power and beauty of  black disabled activists and artists making change, creating space,  innovating, producing challenging and brave new works and  articulating potential futures and ways forward together.",disabled,survival,Black crip magic,activism,disabled,madness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : Black queer, trans and disabled artists led several large-scale  mobilizations that gave us so much life this year, and that changed  the face of the city in the process. These include the 15 day  Black  Lives Matter - Toronto  occupation of the Toronto police  Headquarters in March, their durational performative action during  the Toronto Pride Parade in July and their day-long art-based sit in at  the SIU headquarters in August.  Artists and activists  with disabilities played a large role in leading  these actions, crafting artistic responses the targeted policing that  had resulted in so much black disabled death throughout 2016.  Allied artists wrote a beautiful  open letter  that saw hundreds sign on  in support of this organizing.  Artists Gloria Swain and Mel  Campbell's' solo shows ( Mad Room , and  Point of Origin , respectively)  at Tangled Art Gallery over the summer and fall were met with critical  acclaim and their new bodies of work had people talking about  blackness, disability, madness and self-determination.

" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : In  Mad Room , Swain created an installation that took visitors through  her experience of madness, and the ways that it had informed her  activism, her involvement in Black Lives Matter and in supporting the  lives of trans women of colour, in particular the  Say Her  Name  campaign. Campbell's  Point of Origin  featured textile works  that celebrated spoony magic, playfully moving us stitch by stitch  through astrology, black liberation theory and femme genius. Their  works spanned the gallery space, tactile engagements that were low  relief homages to the power of black disabled people.  And black  queer, trans and gender variant artists captivated during Tangled Art  + Disability's  Cripping the Arts  Symposium and the  Cripping the  Stage  performance evening produced by the British Council at  Harbourfront in the Spring of 2016.

" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : For me, my own black crip magic has gotten me through an  overwhelming year. Autoimmune flare ups and new experiences of  disability affected when, how and where I worked. I've never had a  more successful year, and yet I've also never had a more sucky one.  2016 put the suc(k) in suc-cessful. I found myself with wonderful, new  challenging career opportunities, new collaborations with wonderful  artists and new kinds of organizing and mobilizing options  manifested.

" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : In April, I co-curated  The Summit  with Sarah Garton Stanley through  the National Arts Centre, a three day gathering of disabled artists  and performers. We spent three glorious days practicing collective  care while discussing how to change the shape of Canadian theatre  and the processes of its creation.  I joined the faculty team at the  Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity and began spending time in  Banff, working on programs rooted in Indigenous knowledge and  guided by Elders. In June, I was awarded a Vanier Scholarship, a  national academic award that celebrates Canada's top scholars. That  same month, I was named the Daniel's Spectrum inaugural artist-in- residence. I officially joined the organizing team for Black Lives  Matter Toronto. I developed deeper relationships with other black  artists and planned for new collaborative projects to manifest  throughout the remainder of 2016. Things were definitely on the up.

" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : But then one day in August, I couldn't see out of my left eye. My  vision was cloudy and murky and watery. I brushed it off as long as I  could,  before the pain of it drove me to the emergency department.  I had developed iritis and a cornea infection, likely related to my  autoimmune issues (and perhaps also a touch of careless contact  lens wearing to boot). ",disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : I couldn't see at all, and then not well for weeks. Gone were my  dreamy plans of drawing for 84 hours chunks at the residency, a  continuation of my super-realist  Activist Portrait Series  — large scale  homages to artists and activists drawn in impossibly long  durations.  Academic deadlines had to be delayed. On the closing day  of an exhibition that I had curated, I went to help take it down. I  couldn't wear my corrective lenses, and I wore an eye patch. I ran my  hands along the walls to feel for each artwork. I was really there for  show,  at best there to give instructions to the team about which  work was to be shipped back to where. I had help throughout this  process, and got tremendous support from others who had been  through similar experiences.  ",disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : By early October, the stress of mounting deadlines pushed off by 6  weeks of low/no vision and the stress of the world as it was changing  pushed my autoimmune issues into overdrive. I left on a speaking  tour that would take me from a residency in Banff to two  conferences in Montreal and a lecture in Vancouver. I got a couple of  infections that were hard to kick, and, rather than walking on stage in  Vancouver with my shoulders back and head high, I limped onstage,  dripping with sweat from a high fever caused by a kidney infection.  Not so crip magical. Or maybe it was... but painful magic.   ",crip,disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : Throughout this year I realized that my body had created ways for  me to slow down, to pause in the middle of a storm, to be humbled,  to be human in moments of unreal chaos. Because of my  autoimmune flare ups, I had time to lie in the grass, imagining the  sky. I had to anchor myself in gravity, even as the rollercoaster raged  on around me. Because of these flare ups, I had to reach out to  people, to be offered and to accept help.  ",crip,body,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : I became more free, and even began to imagine myself as something  other than just my work and my production capacity. As artists, we  are expected to produce tremendously and to be endlessly social  while meeting deadline after deadline. Our value is measured by  what we make. But what happens when we cant make? When we  can't see our way into the gallery? When we cant be social or can't  create, not today and not tomorrow either?    In 2016,  I found this out. I became quiet, and I listened more to the  Earth while I lay on it. To my surprise, the sounds of life on this  planet had a lot to say. I fell back into a memory of a way of being  and living that was much more connected to the earth and a more  measured pace of life. I listened to the guidance of Corleigh  Powderface, the Elder I was privileged to be working with in Banff. I  went outside, and I spent time with the trees. I reconnected to Earth.

" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : This process reminded me of this brilliant performance by  Lynx  Sainte-Marie  that I had witnessed at the Cripping the Stage event at  Harbourfront Centre months earlier in 2016. In their performance ,  Sainte-Marie had articulated a futuristic world where the experiences  of folks with disabilities were seen as an appropriate reaction to a  violent system, where the ways that our bodies and minds worked  were magical reactions allowing us to tap into another realm with  essential messages for the survival of all life on this planet. Through  slow and measured movements — and an audio soundscape  — Sainte-Marie imagined a future where the survival of life on this  planet relied on disabled people.

" Magic from the madness: On black disabled : I found myself back where I'd begun the year, listening to black crip  magic and being so moved by our capacity for change and life. And  so, with my shoulders squared, I will take these remaining days of  2016 in my own hands. I will gently and lovingly squeeze out the last  drops, enjoying the slowness of these remaining moments of the  year. And if 2016 fights back, I may even get to lay down again and be  off of the roller coaster for a moment.   PS — As evidence of further crip magic, I exchange deliveries of  desserts with a dear disabled artist and activist friend of mine, who  resides in the US whenever we are sick or ill. Whatever happens for  the rest of the year, I know that my crip sister has my back and that  gluten free treats are just a text or email away. If that's not magic, I  don't know what is.
