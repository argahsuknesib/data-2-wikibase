" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : Over the weekend, I noticed a lot of chatter on Facebook surrounding the story  of  Anaya Ellick , a 7 years old girl from Virginia who won a national penmanship  contest.  Anaya is an African American girl who is a congenital amputee.  The contest  she entered into and won was the Nicholas Maxim Special Award for Excellent  Manuscript Penmanship.  Participants of the contest must be a student with a disability,  and a team of occupational therapists judge the entries and award a winner.  Anaya  beat out 50 other participants to receive this honor, and in the video below, you can  watch Anaya accept the recognition, and hear from her mother and school  administrators about her penmanship. : ",children,disability,Black,girls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : White Privilege & Inspiration Porn:  My Epiphany Moment  The chatter I read on social media focused more on how the article (and several others)  written about Anaya was littered with inspiration porn verbiage rather than celebrating  her #BlackDisabledGirlMagic and sheer awesomeness.  And there was one more thing I  noticed – All of the commenters were White (or White-passing) advocates.  Something  dawned on me in that instant:  There is severe White Privilege at play when it comes to  celebrating or condemning stories about disabled people, and labeling them as  inspiration porn.

" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : I never thought about how White Privilege was at work when we designate stories as  “inspirational” or not, and how we as a collective community react to them.  What  struck me was that only one commenter had focused on Anaya’s ability to write and her  winning the contest.  It bothered me that no one looked beyond the inspiration porn  and focused on the individual – Anaya.  Isn’t that what we harp about when we  “shame” inspiration porn –  that fact that it devalues the person and zeroes in on what  makes them “different” (and in some cases, gives able-bodied/neurotypical people that  “feel good” tingle)?   I ardently despise inspiration porn, but as an advocate who focuses on the  achievements and experiences of disabled Black girls and women (and other disabled  girls and women of color), I do not have the “luxury” of picking and choosing stories  that depict us in a positive, non-inspirational light.  Why is that?  Because our stories  do not get the same or fair amount of spotlight and recognition as the ones that feature  White disabled people.  Black disabled people are doing phenomenal work each and  every day, whether it is in the classroom like Anaya, or  graduating from high school  with Honors like Deva , advocating for the inclusion of disabled people like  Haben Girma ,  and many others.

" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : When there are “slim pickings” of stories about Back disabled people, we, Black  disabled advocates, have to ask ourselves the following question:   “Do I swallow my  pride and hatred for inspiration porn in order to uplift the story(ies) of a fellow  Black disabled person, or refuse to share, and not support my people?” For me, I choose to swallow my pride to uplift us because if I do not, who  will?  Celebrating our achievements is more important to me than fighting about every  inspiration porn offense – my people matter, and I have trained myself to overlook the  inspiration porn with the determination in letting the world know that our stories are  just as important as others in the community.

" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : How Other Black Disabled Advocate View Inspiration Porn, & the White  Privilege Connection When I shared my “epiphany” about the white privilege and inspiration porn  connection, I had two Black disabled advocates share similar sentiments.     Anita Cameron of  Musings of an Angry Black Womyn , shared her thoughts about white  privilege and inspiration porn:  Inspiration porn disgusts me, but when the achievements of Black disabled folks are so  rarely noted that they seem nonexistent, we’ve got to take what we can get.  The default face of disability is White. You don’t hear much of Black disabled [people]  unless we’re being killed.  Our stories are pretty much left out – of history, of culture,  everything.  So, when stories of us are told that aren’t negative, we have to treasure  them even when they are inspiration porn.  White folks can afford to be pissed off about  inspiration porn because the stories are overwhelmingly about them.

" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : Heather Watkins of  Slow Walkers See More , commented on why she chooses to share  these stories and overlook the inspirational feels:  … Speaking as a disabled woman of color, better to know about her [the story of  Anaya], connect with her and mom and introduce her to other disabled women of color  who are also congenital amputees/amputees, reached out to the mother.  That way the  exposure from the disability community specifically from folks she’d be able to relate  will form new self-awareness and the parents will learn also, hopefully not to cap her  potential based on disability.   …personally, it’s one of the main reasons I write to share my own story because I didn’t  see the stories of disabled women of color across media landscape, like we don’t exist  or something.  The Power of Telling Our Stories, Our Way One truth we can all agree on is the importance of telling our stories our way.  Having  that kind of power over your own voice and experience is why I created RYV! – I did not  want anyone telling my story, or the stories of other disabled people of color, in a way  that devalued or harmed us.  As Anita stated, each time we read about a Black disabled  person and it is not about us being victimized, traumatized, or killed, we hold tight to  those stories because we see a part of ourselves in each person recognized.  I know  that happened for me when I read Anaya’s story; it made me flashback to my  elementary school years when I received accolades about doing good work and being  an Honor Roll student.  As I have stated time and time again, representation matters  tremendously; when diverse stories about the disabled experience is made available,  we have to be mindful of how those who have multiple identities feel about those  stories and what those stories may mean to and for them.    Final Thoughts Inspiration porn is an issue that we all must take a stand against; however, we have to  realize that merely complaining about its existence will not change journalism or how  our stories are shared or discussed in the media.  Educating able-bodied and  neurotypical journalists, reporters, writers, bloggers, etc., about the correct  terminology and lingo is an imperative step in eradicating inspiration porn’s  actuality.  There are many of us who are working hard to make this occur; one such  proactive effort is the webinar Lawrence Carter-Long and David Perry will be hosting on  Wednesday May 11th, titled  Getting Beyond Stereotypes:  Better Disability  Journalism .  This is a free webinar that I signed up for last month, and I feel that this is  a great means to help those in communications and mass media better report and  depict our stories the way we would like them – authentically minus the sympathy and  “awwws” we normally are exposed to.

" White Privilege & Inspiration Porn : I hope that one day, I will have the privilege of vehemently shaming inspiration porn  stories about Black disabled people, and having a slew of stories to select from that are  not problematic to share on social media as my fellow White disabled advocates have  the luxury of doing.  I refuse to be shamed or having to defend why I share posts that  have an inspirational feel – I share because I want our stories to be known, and in  some cases, I have to bypass the inspiration porn to make that happen.  Inspiration  porn does not take away the strength, confidence, resilience, or excellence of the  individual – the individual continues to be who they are fearlessly and  unapologetically.  Understanding those truths is why I will steadfastly uplift the  portrayals of Black disabled people because I need to read and see depictions of my  people in the same regard as I need air to breathe – we are truly each other’s lifelines  and validations in this community.
