" New play After the Blackout is breaking down barriers for : both its artists and its audience This is Tamyka Bullen's first interview. It's also my first interview with  a deaf performer. :  We spent a lot of time coordinating with interpreters, speaking  through email, figuring out our conversation and balancing what  each of us would need for us to understand each other. I even  learned some basic ASL to get our conversation started. In the end, I  was too timid to sign, but none of that mattered anyway. That's  because meeting Tamyka Bullen is like walking into a room full of  sunshine. Her smile, humour and ease, even through her  nervousness, communicate more than any verbal greeting could  have.

" New play After the Blackout is breaking down barriers for : Born from a testimonial workshop and blossomed into a full length  production,  After the Blackout  interweaves the personal histories of  the performers with those of the fictional characters they play.  Communication between the actors has been one of the most  challenging aspects, such as figuring out how Prince Amponsah — an  actor who recently lost his arms in a fire — would communicate with  Tamyka or the other deaf actress Catherine Joell Mackinnon. To  accomplish this, they used a combination of interpreters or voice-to- text through iPads in rehearsal and then developed a series of cues  to prompt each actor during performances.
