These constructed ideas are deeply rooted in anti-Blackness, eugenics,  misogyny, colonialism, imperialism and capitalism. This form of systemic oppression leads to  people and society determining who is valuable and worthy based on a person’s language,  appearance, religion and/or their ability to satisfactorily [re]produce, excel and ""behave.""
