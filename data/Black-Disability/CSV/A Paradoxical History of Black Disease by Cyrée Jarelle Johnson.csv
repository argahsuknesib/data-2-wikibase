" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : Content notes: slavery, white supremacy, racism, genocide, violence, death Just two months after the Civil War ended, freedmen began to die in droves from contagious  diseases, such as cholera and smallpox. Their former slavers, however, attributed the high  mortality of these diseases among those they had once traded as property to an inherent  physical and moral inferiority. “Nothing on earth could make them wash,” asserted a tourist from  Britain recounted in Marshall Scott Legan’s “Disease and the Freedmen in Mississippi during  Reconstruction.” Initially, little concern was given to the fact that freedmen lived in densely  populated portions of the city and without the means or plumbing to wash frequently—conditions  engineered by the white powers that be.  : ",enslavement,freedom,Black health,enslaved people,racism,history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : In the months that followed, a smallpox sick house was destroyed as it was built, likely due to  the association of smallpox with black people. This left black-run organizations and the  Freedman’s Bureau completely responsible for stopping the march of smallpox through black  communities in the Eastern United States, Legan asserts. Since they could no longer own black  people, they happily left us for dead. Legan notes that former slaveholders were “freed of the  antebellum master-slave relationship in which the blacks had represented capital investment”  and thus “expressed little concern for the health and welfare of the freedmen except when it  posed a threat to their own.”  Black illness is treated as inevitable and attributed to some inherent racial inferiority. This  attitude both evinces and encourages a lax, shrugging attitude towards black illness and death.  If a disease, like smallpox, like COVID-19, is only affecting black people why not open the  economy, why do anything to halt its progression, wonders non-black America. Meanwhile black  people die in large numbers while white people are treated with care by medical providers and  survive.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : As I write this, over  79,500 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States ; by the time this  article is published, the number will be far higher. The disease is spreading rapidly in cities  known for their black culture: New York City, New Orleans, St. Louis. In each of these cities  black people are dying in numbers disproportionate to our population as a whole.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : Now, as ever, once The President and his cadré of inepts learned that black people composed  the majority of deaths the focus shifted from harm reduction to personal responsibility. “It’s very  sad,” noted Dr. John Fauci during a press briefing in early April “there’s nothing we can do about  it right now.” To him, it came down to “health disparities” and “comorbidities,” which we know to  mean disabilities and chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease.  The  Surgeon General  asked black people to halt transmission of COVID-19 for those we love,  saying “do it for granddaddy, do it for your big mama, do it for your Pop Pop…we need you to  step up and stop the spread.” He also mentioned that handwashing was less common in cash- poor households than in those with higher incomes.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : He did not, however, mention that “cities in the United States, including Baltimore, Chicago, and  Detroit, have seen thousands of water shutoffs resulting from unpaid bills. Residents have had  to buy or “borrow” water while they were shut off, and here as in the rest of the world, expensive  water results in compromised hygiene,” as Isha Ray did in her article  “Handwashing in the Time  of COVID-19.”  Now, as in the time of smallpox, black people are burdened with stopping a  disease that we did not create while the government ignores solutions that could maximize  black access to essential resources and lessen the death count among black people.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : The government, like the loser that heads it, takes no responsibility for the way that they have  created the conditions for COVID-19 to ravage the black community. They take no responsibility  for the way that their ham-handed treatment of life sustaining medication caused a shortage in  sick and chronically ill communities and will likely continue to do so. They fail to understand or  nefariously pretend to fail to understand how the history of anti-black racial apartheid in the  United States made black people sitting ducks for deadly viruses past and present.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : Like COVID-19,  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  is a disease that disproportionately sickens and  kills black people.  Hydroxychloroquine , a medication used to stop flares—times when  rheumatological diseases are active and cause the most damage—in Lupus, Rheumatoid  Arthritis, and other rheumatological diseases, was touted as a miracle cure to COVID-19 without  a clinical trial or an ounce of proof. Seemingly overnight, people with Lupus, like myself, were  unable to access our prescriptions.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : Lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks the body. Severe manifestations are  relatively common and sometimes deadly. The disease is associated with death in black  families and black culture. Among those who died of lupus complications are J. Dilla, Michael  Jackson, and N’Deaye Ba. Many of these complications are caused by inflammation, and the  deterioration of major organs because your body sees them as an invader. COVID-19 relies on  inflammation to kill as well. In addition to respiratory failure, COVID-19 kills by creating  inflammation that attacks major organs as well. It can cause strokes, heart attacks, and blood  clots; it kills otherwise healthy people with cruel ease.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : So why then were a population already highly at risk to all of these maladies left without their  medical standard of care, as Hydroxychloroquine is sometimes called for Lupus and RA? If the  White House had suddenly become privy to medical inequity and the chronic illnesses it causes,  why did they see fit to say the name of a drug that people rely upon on the nightly news until  people stockpiled it in a panic like it was a 40-pack of toilet paper rolls? And most importantly, if  our medication could cure, prevent, or even slow COVID-19, why was the solution to snatch sick  people off of our regimens and redistribute it to others? Why were some of the most vulnerable  people in this crisis deemed unfit to medication that may save our lives  when we already had  regulated prescription access? Because of the assumption that black sick people can and should live without their medication if  abled white people happen to need it. Drug manufacturers and insurance companies said as  much.  Kaiser Permanente  noted that Hydroxychloroquine stayed in the body “for up to 40 days”  as though that was a comfort. Doctors, and even dentists in some cases, wrote prescriptions for  themselves and their families. People with Lupus and other rheumatological diseases watched  their prescriptions go unfilled as pharmacies in New York and California mysteriously ran dry.  Even though the President and his henchmen claimed to understand the role of disability and  chronic illness in making COVID-19 more deadly, their actions evidenced that even when no  additional assistance beyond filling existing prescriptions was needed we would not be spared  from harm.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : We were deemed totally disposable, just a roadblock in the way of getting everyone  else  our  meds. The removal of medication access seemed to signal that the medical industrial  complex thought we would be just fine without our life sustaining medication. Yet the lack of  care took the idea of black illness for granted, even knowing the environmental, social, and  historical context from which it emerged, and elected us the ideal casualties of this disease. We  were deemed enough to live without the medication that keeps us alive, yet inherently too sick  to survive the latest plague and there’s nothing anyone can do about it: the paradox of black  disease.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : The history of this ambivalence is as old as the black/white racial divide, stemming from white  vacillation as to whether or not black people are superhumanly immune to disease, or  subhuman and genetically helpless in the face of illness. A purported immunity to malaria and  yellow fever among the peoples of West Africa was part of the driving forces of the Transatlantic  slave trade. Black history in the United States is predicated on this dichotomy, created and  enforced by whites to work black people to death as their property or leave us to die in  conditional freedom.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : But this duality lives elsewhere, too. It’s the attitude that an unarmed black person should be  shot dozens of times, but a white mass shooter should be run through the local Burger King  drive-thru. It’s the same sentiment that believes black women have too many children, and  watches them die giving birth. The system that frames us as engaging in “drug-seeking”  behavior when we ask for pain medication is one that admits its belief that black illness is a  given and the current systems of the United States bears no responsibility to treat us. It’s a  disgusting, self-serving binary that views black people as unharmable when it wants to hurt us  and as naturally “defective” when we cry out that we are hurt.

" A Paradoxical History of Black Disease: Cyrée Jarelle Johnson : At no single time in the history of the United States have black people been allowed to just be  human: in need of medical care, vulnerable to harm, in want of nutritious food, warm clothing,  and shelter fit for human beings. The only options non-black people give us is the role of  superhuman monstrosity impervious to sickness and bullets, or a subhuman animal euthanized  at the first hint of illness, and the historical treatment of black contagious disease reflects this  reality.
