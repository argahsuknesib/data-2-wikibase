" Introduction : This collection of writing has grown from the work of the National Black  Disability Coalition (NBDC), led by Jane Dunhamn and Leroy Moore. The  NBDC was founded to advance knowledge about Black disability, both in the  US and throughout the African Diaspora. The organization's mission  statement is, in part, ""to create a space for inquiry within universities that  brings together faculty and students [… ] to consider Black disability issues  within broad-based social, cultural and historical contexts.""  Elaborating on  this mission, in a speech at Temple University in March 2015, coalition co- chair Jane Dunham stated that, among our most important tasks, is to put out  a call to action to Black students with disabilities, so that they can lead the  next wave of change. This collection of writings is offered in the spirit of that  call, and includes a collaboratively-authored Black disability studies (hereafter  Black DS) syllabus, as well as reflections from members of the Coalition on  their experiences of teaching and learning in Black DS classrooms. : ",National Black Disability Coalition,Black,disability,Black Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Introduction : It is not our intention to give a definitive picture of what Black DS pedagogy  ""is,"" but rather to suggest some of the things it  may  be, and become, as it  grows. In addition to furthering the goals laid out in the mission statement of  the Black DS Coalition, we also wish to give educators and students a sense  of how they might begin to incorporate some of the principles of Black DS,  and disability justice more broadly, into the learning spaces they inhabit.   Throughout this collection of writings, we advocate for Black DS to be  taken,  not  as a marginalized special-topic course, but rather as a crucial part  of all disability studies courses and pedagogies, as well as all Black and  Africana Studies courses. We recognize that, like disability itself, Black DS  cannot simply be ""added and stirred"" into existing pedagogies; rather, the  inclusion of Black DS is a paradigm-shifting change. The pieces included in  this collection are enactments of an ongoing conversation—a conversation  that we hope the readers of  Disability Studies Quarterly  will join thoughtfully.

" Introduction : The following sections comprise statements from the leaders of the National  Black Disability Coalition, Jane Dunhamn and Leroy Moore; reflective writings  from two students and two instructors of Black disability studies; and a copy of  the pilot syllabus. As co-chairs of the NBDC, Dunhamn and Moore both bring  decades of experience in anti-racist, disability and arts organizing to their  words; their pieces offer a historical and cultural introduction to the rise of the  NBDC, and show how its efforts encompass not only pedagogy and  scholarship, but also community- and arts-based work. From this broader  historical/cultural background, our collage of voices then brings forward work  from students Shancia Jarrett and Britney Robinson, each of whom offers an  individual perspective on her experience of learning Black DS and applying its  intersectional critiques to her work in and after college. Finally, the two pieces  from instructors Akemi Nishida and Sami Schalk highlight the ways that  specific locations (geographical, historical, cultural) shape the work of Black  DS pedagogy, as well as some of the interesting questions that might arise in  the Black DS classroom.

" Introduction : The pilot syllabus, presented at the end, is the collaborative effort of many  NBDC members. This syllabus can be adapted for use in a wide variety of  classrooms, not only those formally designated as ""Black DS"" pedagogical  spaces. Our purpose is to invite more students and instructors into active  discussion and engagement with these ideas, so that the meaning of what  ""Black DS pedagogy"" is can continue to grow.

" Who Shall Introduce the Subject? : Jane Dunhamn, Director, National Black Disability Coalition The past two years of Black disability studies (Black DS) exploration have  proven to be rewarding and overwhelming. I would like to thank the Black DS  Committee. From the beginning, the journey of discovery took us home. It was  the historic Shiloh Baptist Church that offered us space and fed us well. Our  organizer, Deacon Jerome Harris simply asked Rev. Armstrong to host us,  and resoundingly, his response was yes! When we met in June 2013, there  were many people in the audience who were new to the concepts of disability  studies and queer studies. This is, again, testimony that when we come  together we grow. That is not to say it is always without struggle. : ",Black Disability Studies,National Black Disability Coalition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Who Shall Introduce the Subject? : The most difficult and formidable challenge to Black DS are the two  intersections that gave rise to the need for this area of work. The first is, how  can Black DS be incorporated into disability studies with authenticity and the  commitment to include community action, much as with the model of  Black/Africana Studies? In other words, who is competent to introduce the  subject from an Afro-disability perspective? The second is, how can Black DS  be incorporated into Black/Africana Studies, where there has been little to no  knowledge of disability studies? In other words, who is competent to introduce  the subject from a disability-Afro perspective?  Both questions take me back 20 years to my anti-racism training. This  particular course was taught/led by a Black, gay, assistant attorney general.  The class was predominantly White, and many folks were from the  Department of Justice, including clerical staff, probation officers, attorneys and  judges. All in the class were there because they truly cared and wanted to do  the work. The trainer took us, White and people of color, back to our earliest  experiences and feelings about race. We all reached a painful discovery about  ourselves and our collective race experience exhibited in deep sorrowful  crying. The stories of pain from racism by people of color from early childhood  and the experience of White people from early childhood, who thought they  had escaped racist beliefs and behaviors because of how they were raised,  gave rise to the class coming together and understanding that racism had not  eluded any of us.  ",disability,Black Disability Studies,race,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Who Shall Introduce the Subject? : This experience reminds me that shifts in perspective come not only from  information and policy, but also from personal experience. For example,  before the passage of the ADA, Judge David S. Admire, Chairman, Criminal  Justice Department, Bethany College, implemented an innovative program for  defendants whom he recognized as having non-apparent disabilities, reducing  recidivism by 43%. He wrote:  As a judge, I was continually confronted with offenders whose behavior was  unexpected and surprising. This was observed not only during their criminal  activity but during their travel through the criminal process. This behavior did  not appear to be intentional, but rather an inappropriate response to the  circumstances that existed at the time. Furthermore, this behavior reminded  me of the behavior of my two children who had been diagnosed with learning  disabilities (LD) and attention deficit disorder (ADD). This collision of my  personal and professional lives began a journey into the fascinating and  complex world of neurobiology and its impact on the criminal justice system.  (Admire, 2006)  It is the work of each of us who believes in Black DS to help one another learn  what we need to know to assist students in their discovery. We must be able  to own our biases in race and disability to grow into this new field of study.  ",ADA,disability,Black Disability Studies,,race,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability: From Hiding to Displaying : Leroy F. Moore Jr., Chair, Black Disability Studies Committee of the National  Black Disability Coalition The National Black Disability Coalition (NBDC) has been working on creating  a working theory and practice of Black DS. Once again we continue the  conversation about disability identity from a Black perspective. We agree it is  different from dominant culture disability, but the questions are—What are the  differences? How does the Black community display those differences? And  how do Black disabled people, family members, and loved ones sit within their  disability in their communities? It is the intent of Black DS to examine many  questions and experiences, provide research and engage Black disabled  scholars. The range from history, culture, arts, sciences, leadership, and  politics from the experience of Black people with disabilities must have a  home that is Afro-centric, most importantly to engage Black disabled pride and  knowledge. : ",National Black Disability Coalition,Black Disability Studies,disability,Black,culture,Black communities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability: From Hiding to Displaying : I must be clear that NBDC cannot and will not speak for all Black disabled  people; however, we too have extensive knowledge and first hand  experiences as Black disabled people. Many scholars have written about  disability history from medicalization to institutionalization to civil rights to  disability rights movement to disability culture. Although we have new books,  for example, Terry Rowden's  The Songs of Blind Folk: African American  Musicians and the Cultures of Blindness  and Dea H. Boster's  African  American Slavery and Disability: Bodies, Property and Power in the  Antebellum South, 1800-1860  (Studies in African American History and  Culture), outside of all the growth in disability studies, the view of disability in  the Black community has only shifted marginally. We have grown from hiding  disability to survive under slavery, to displaying disability under harsh abuse in  freak shows, to playing disability to receive services.   ",National Black Disability Coalition,disability rights,Black,disabled people,Black communities,history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability: From Hiding to Displaying : The above history helped shape how Blacks from the 1970s through today  view disability. My parents' generation often viewed disability as something to  overcome or something to be labeled with to receive services or to be  classified into for special education. Beginning in the 1990s, current disability  culture has very lightly touched the Black community with events controlled for  and by the Black disabled community, for example: Vision Awards, Black  Disabled Leadership Summit, Not Everyone Reads Black Authors campaign  and the Black, Gifted and Disabled campaign by the National Black Disability  Coalition (NBDC) and New Vision: Disabled Poets and Artists of color under  Disability Advocates of Minorities Organization (DAMO) and Harambee  Education Council for the Black community in Oakland, California. These  activities have planted seeds to not only increase legal rights and services but  to increase leadership, arts and culture in the Black disabled community. This  has been a slow process; many organizations have come and gone, but each  step has helped to chip away the ""overcoming disability"" attitude in the Black  community.   ",history,Black people,disability,National Black Disability Coalition,art,culture,Black community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability: From Hiding to Displaying : As we know, the hiding of disability was mainstream and not only tied to the  Black community, as we saw in former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  However, what is different was the birth of institutional disability power, first  with parents of disabled children, and then people with disabilities who began  protesting for their rights. Both groups were composed of members of the  dominant culture who stepped into these newly found positions within the  disability organizations they had created. They were not required or called to  check their privilege when setting up these organizations that should have  created the reshaping of disability identity with a disability culture viewpoint  that benefited everyone. However, because of institutional practices that  shaped early disability organizations, the isms in our society seeped into  these disability institutions which created roadblocks for ""others"" to enjoy the  benefits that came out of these organizations.  ",disability,Black community,privilege,Black community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability: From Hiding to Displaying : Similar to disability rights, disability culture continues to have trouble reaching  people outside of dominant culture who have little access or resources to  higher education. Even today in secondary education settings disability is  mixed with many factors and practices that disconnects and marginalize  disabled students and their parents. It is mostly segregation, seclusion and  restraints that separate disabled students from other students. How can  disability pride show up in the Black community after segregated, stigmatizing  education systems?  In the past, pride and shame have conflicted in the Black community. On one  side Black culture has been full of pride to fight back from the mainstream  negative messages toward Black people. On the other side, Black pride was  taught that it had to be shown at certain times with certain people  understanding that too much pride can cause discrimination and harm from  dominant culture. Even during the most difficult times in our history, Black  pride has always been a part of the Black community. Even so, the treatment  and viewpoint of disability pride was non-existent. The attitude of the Black  community has grown from cursing disabled people, to hiding, to obtaining  services, to overcoming, to most recently realizing that Black disabled people  have history and have always been in every movement from Reconstruction  to Disability Rights.  ",disability rights,culture,Black community,education,stigma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability: From Hiding to Displaying : We can see that viewpoints change when people begin organizing with new  thinking. Today, many Black disabled people are taking what the disability  rights/culture movements laid out and mixing it with Black culture and pride to  write, sing and create visual arts that speak to the Black disabled experience.  The National Black Disability Coalition is working to spread Black disabled  culture and history in the Black community and, most importantly, to establish  Black DS, through the work of the Black DS Committee. Black DS will provide  a guide to scholarly institutions of the interest and need for students to include  intellectual skills in the subject matter for future fields of study which translate  to a better understanding of the Black Disabled experience. At the end of the  day it is always about the growth of people.

" Lost and Found: The Stories of Blacks with Disabilities Found In the : Community  Shancia Jarrett The concept of disability and its impact on the Black community is vaguely  discussed as a reality within the discipline of disability studies. Within my first  semester of graduate school, I engaged disability solely as a philosophical  and sociological construct derived from the experiences and the theories of  White scholars. These pedagogies ascribed terminological values to disability  based on the individualistic perspectives of White scholars. The designers of  these predominant approaches to disability fail to holistically provide a diverse  approach to engage the multicultural aspects of disability. As a Black woman,  who academically and actively engages disability, I realize that the  predominant theories of disability which disregard the experiences of Blacks  undermine the impact and existence of disability within minority communities.  Disability is a non-discriminatory reality; anyone can acquire a disability. Thus,  theories which deny the non-discriminatory reality of race fail to adequately  represent disability. : ",disability,Black community,pedagogy,Black women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Lost and Found: The Stories of Blacks with Disabilities Found In the : As a result of the omission of people of color from disability studies, I cannot  academically encompass the works of Blacks within classroom settings. The  concrete and present conditions of being Black and disabled fail to withhold  any significant or tangible impact within my studies. For instance, during the  course ""Narratives and Disability,"" none of the personal accounts narrated the  voice and the experiences of the African Diaspora. Within this course, I  pondered whether or not Black disabled authors and scholars existed?  Additionally, I questioned if academia considered the works and experiences  of Blacks were valuable to field of Disability Studies?   Within this reflection, I do not intend to cast blame on the teachings of my  talented pedagogues. Instead, I consider it to be an opportunity to provide  awareness, understanding, and intervention. Ironically, a majority of my  counterparts are truly unaware of what it means to be Black in the United  States of America. Furthermore, when I reflect on disability and the realities of  being Black, it becomes evident that social disparities such as racism and  discrimination impede the union of Blacks into the disabled community. So  often, disability within Black communities becomes concealed under the  blanket of homelessness, substance abuse, violence, and poverty. Hence,  societies and dominant cultures fail to pinpoint markers of disability due to its  covert nature.

" Lost and Found: The Stories of Blacks with Disabilities Found In the : In my attempt to understand the ramifications of disability within my  community and personal encounters, I considered asking two simple  questions:  1. How do we identify disability?  2. How do we engage the disabled community?   The first question concerning the identification of disability provided me with  the privilege of awareness. Through awareness, I received the opportunity to  witness the life and relationships of disabled Blacks. The privilege of  awareness allowed me to critically examine disability beyond its distinctive  nature of labels and diagnosis. Disability is not only a semantic marker, but  also an undeniable reality of happiness and hardships. In other words,  disability symbolized life. The second question of engagement required me to  not only observe but to also consider the humanity of those who are Black and  disabled. In order to find opportunities of engagement and appease my  curiosity, I committed my efforts to volunteering within community-based and  government agencies which served underrepresented communities. As  advocates and health-care professionals work with people with disabilities,  they must be knowledgeable of the ethnic backgrounds of their clients to fully  serve the disabled population.

" Lost and Found: The Stories of Blacks with Disabilities Found In the : Collectively, these questions promoted my academic research and my efforts  of intervention. Within these opportunities, it was apparent that institutional  frameworks of discrimination derived from racism hindered the acceptance  and the advocacy efforts towards disabled Blacks. Most importantly, the  classroom could not teach me these realities. Outside the classroom and into  the urban communities, I witnessed the accounts of Blacks with disabilities.  Overall, their stories were limited and buffered by neglect. It makes no sense  for us to buffer the engagement of disability by arguing on the philosophical  and sociological nature of disability, if we deny the experiences of people of  color. Why? To ignore is to neglect and to neglect is to deny. Blacks cannot  be ignored, neglected, or denied; we are humans.

" A Work/Activist in Progress : Britney Robinson I was unaware of the existence of the disability community prior to taking a  course on disabilities studies during my last undergraduate semester at  Spelman. At the time, what I assumed to be true about people with disabilities  was not complex. Their presence or personal stories were not typical  occurrences for me; so, I ""othered"" individuals with disabilities. Full  understanding of the social prejudice, discrimination and marginalization due  to one having an impairment (whether physical or mental), and my role in that  context, had never been a thought before. : ",disability,community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Work/Activist in Progress : So why did I sign up for a disability studies course? What did I hope to gain  from such a class? My purpose in registering was to increase my public health  knowledge (my desired career field) about a group of people whom I saw as  needing health care assistance. Coming to the class as a Black woman taking  a class with a few other Black women, learning about our history or myself,  was not a part of the plan. Discovering a part of my being that I did not know  existed but had shamed and hidden away was not a part of the plan. You see,  the course was not named something conspicuous like ""Black Disabilities  Studies,"" which would have alerted me that Blackness and disability could be  one. The course was called ""Composing Disability, Health and Wellness""  which set off no alarms in me that Blackness was related.

" A Work/Activist in Progress : The class was based on a reading (or piece of media), followed by a seminar- style discussion. For the first two weeks of the course we read literature, then  engaged in class discussions about the medical and social model of  disabilities, what health is, and some implications of being a visibly disabled  person. Afterwards we dove into Black DS literature and narratives which  centered on the intersection between Blackness and disability. Such topics  resonated quickly with me and us as we quickly included gender and sexual  orientation to the intersection (which was natural in an environment such as  ours). We freely expressed our interpretations of and reactions to the use of  disabled, Black bodies as propaganda for the call to the end of slavery. We  held heated conversations (which many times continued as we left the  classroom) expressing our shared outrage of the disregarding of and at times  denial of mental health on our campus even with its call for physical and  dietary health. ""Staring,"" invisible disabilities and accessibility were concepts  we were able to examine from the readings, and then identify with people with  disabilities on and/or relate to our lived experiences. Our lived experiences  came out in the classroom in such a way that would likely not have occurred  in a different setting such as with a majority male audience or at a  predominantly white institution (PWI).

" A Work/Activist in Progress : A project that stands out for me was an accessibility audit we performed on  our campus. We found that our campus bookstore's elevator was packed near  top to bottom with boxes of books and paraphernalia; the majority of our  dorms possessed only a staircase as an entryway; many campus buildings'  restrooms lacked grab rails. These findings were shocking to us. We  understood that many of the buildings on the campus were historic; however,  we also recognized that some fixes, such as clearing out an elevator or  installing a grab rail, were simple and inexpensive. As a result of the project, I  gained a newfound appreciation of accessible buildings and structures which I  still practice today. A second result of the project was that we prepared some  of our findings to be recommended for resolution.  ",access,campus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Work/Activist in Progress : The effect of our BDS course did not end once we left the classroom.

" Teaching Disability Studies in the Shadow of Black Lives Matter : Protests  Akemi Nishida The brainstorming and writing of this reflection occurred while I was involved  in nation-wide protests that were asserting that ""Black Lives Matter.""

" Teaching Disability Studies in the Shadow of Black Lives Matter :  As I teach disability studies at urban  public universities, I continue to encounter moments when racism, ableism,  and sanism are deeply entangled and seem impossible to separate from one  another. These moments are when I face the countless narratives by students  about how their race played a significant part of them becoming disabled or  being diagnosed with disabilities, or how their life options (e.g., occupation)  are structurally limited at the intersection of race and disability. While I teach  the basics of disability studies, from the social model through the disability  pride discourse of the disability rights movement, these student narratives and  their critical questioning set the pedagogy of the course. They articulate the  pitfall within what is considered to be the  basics  of disability studies,  particularly in relation to its racial neutrality.  ",disability,racism,ableism,sanism,the academy,intersectionality,disability studies,pedagogy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Teaching Disability Studies in the Shadow of Black Lives Matter : Disabling effects of racist violence is one of the examples where the Black DS  and many of my students challenge disability studies to pause and seriously  engage in the conjunction of racial violence and disability: including  unnecessarily over or under diagnosis, hypo- and hyper- medicalization of  bodyminds, and on-going police violence. Racism entails direct and  debilitating violence. Or racism is infused with environmental injustices (e.g.,  polluted industrial wastes are dumped into racial minority neighborhood or  nations of the Global South) or armed conflicts that disable many bodyminds  of racial and ethnic minorities. The social model of disability, for example,  needs to be extended out of its racial neutrality position within which  exemplary issues of inaccessible built environments or exclusionary social  norms are analyzed solely in relation to disabilities and stripped off of the  racist, classist, and other influences. Social conditions that debilitate many  people are profoundly racially coded, and disability studies needs to integrate  into its analysis the racial, class-based, and other injustices that shape the  making of disability. When the classroom is overwhelmingly filled with the  testimonies of students (in classes I teach, white students are the minority)  who were ""pushed to"" segregated special education classes throughout their  educational histories and/or who became disabled as a result of neighborhood  gang-related violence, or when activists continue to raise the issue of how  racial environmental injustices and ableism and sanism conjunct (e.g.,  Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha in Sins Invalid, 2013), I am reminded and  frustrated with the disability studies' investment in the ""racial neutrality"" or  more precisely its ignorance and avoidance of critical racial analysis (Bell,  2006). Moreover, while the concept of disability pride has been a key for  community building and the mobilization of people within disability rights  movements, what also needs to be addressed and fought against is racist  violence which causes disability for many people of color.

Nonetheless, as people  chant fiercely that ""Black Lives Matter,"" the bold leadership which has been  taken by Black DS advocates to integrate disability studies and Black studies  and foreground lives of Black disabled people, needs to be heard and  followed by the larger disability studies as well as integrated and centered  within the disability studies pedagogy.

" Beyond Analogies: Challenges of Teaching Black Disability Studies : Sami Schalk In my recent course ""Disability in Contemporary African American Literature,""  I introduced upper level students, primarily women of color, to disability  studies and to the study of Blackness and disability in literature. I had taught  disability studies courses before, but never one so explicitly focused on race.  In this reflection, I want to share some of the challenges I faced in getting  students to understand the relationship of both Blackness and disability and  racism and ableism. These challenges, I believe, are more likely to occur in  Black DS courses where race is central to the course. : ",disability studies,women of color,race,ableism,Black disability studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Beyond Analogies: Challenges of Teaching Black Disability Studies : Disability studies scholars have already discussed the problems of and limits  to oppression analogies, that is, comparisons between two marginalized  groups. Often these comparisons reduce the issues of one group in favor of  another, while at other times, analogies deny the existence of individuals  belonging to both oppressed groups. At the same time, we know that  analogies can sometimes be useful to help students understand the  oppression of groups they do not belong to, potentially creating allies. In my  course, analogies were often useful as we discussed how discourses of  disability were used against Black people collectively to enslave them. By  discussing how the rhetoric of mental capacity has been used to deny the  rights and humanity of many groups of people throughout history, my students  were able to make connections between histories of oppression. Analogies  then served me well as I introduced key concepts to my students. I quickly  found, however, that students understood discourses of disability to be  weapons of racism, that is, part of pseudo-science long disproven and safely  kept in the past. As a result, when we moved into discussing books with  contemporary settings, students moved from analogies to conflations and  erasures.  ",oppression,language,disability,disability,racism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Beyond Analogies: Challenges of Teaching Black Disability Studies : When we began to discuss texts such as Audre Lorde's  The Cancer Journals ,  Meri Nana-Ama Danquah's  Willow Weep for Me  and Bebe Moore  Campbell's  72 Hour Hold , students easily comprehended how the intersection  of race and disability made life more difficult for the disabled Black women in  these texts; however, they struggled to understand the relationship of ableism  and racism in these texts at a structural (not merely individual) level—as they  were able to do when we discussed discourses of disability used during the  antebellum period. Instead, students began to resort to phrases such as ""She  was disabled by her race"" or ""Her gender became a social disability.""  Disability quickly lost its social, material and political significance as a  category of oppression and became merely a synonym for ""disadvantage."" I  pushed students to use disability to refer to impairment, identity, discourse or  a social system/social construct, but again and again the same conflating  phrases appeared. Disability as a socially constructed category marginalized  in the contemporary US, quickly became a catch-all for all oppressions. We  are all disabled in some way…  Why did this occur? Of course the easiest answer is the English language.  Disability, impairment, and handicap in both verb and noun forms are each  used in all kinds of ways not related to disability as in disability studies—from  golf to broken down cars on the side of the highway. Another easy answer is  that students are relatively knowledgeable about issues of race and gender— they tend to know at least something about Civil Rights and feminisms—but  disability rights is less familiar; ableism is an unknown term and concept.  While I believe these issues are part of the reason my students have  struggled to discuss race and disability in contemporary settings beyond  explicit representations of intersectionality (Black disabled characters), there  is more going on here. The above two problems are challenges faced by most  of us teaching disability studies courses to students unfamiliar with the field.  The specific challenge I believe that occurs in teaching Black DS is helping  students understand structural racism and ableism as impacting all Black  people, not merely those who are disabled. When I talk to students about lack  of access to healthcare, incarceration, violence, war and other social issues  which disproportionately impact people of color, I try to get them to also see  how structural racism also therefore disproportionately positions people of  color to be(come) disabled. If ableism is the discrimination against people with  disabilities and the valuing and privileging of nondisabled bodies, what do we  make of discourses around Black bodies which use metaphors of disease,  illness, dying, curing, and healing? How are these discourses racist and how  are they also deeply ableist?   The challenge I see in teaching Black DS is to help students understand how  racism and ableism collude in a variety of ways in contemporary society, not  only in the lives of Black disabled people, but also Black people collectively as  discourses of disability continue to be used as means to control and do harm  to racialized populations. I believe the best way to do this is to incorporate  discussions of Black DS into both disability studies and Black/Africana studies  courses. As scholars, activists, instructors and students begin to understand  the various intersections, parallels and overlaps between the experiences of  Black people, the experiences of people with disabilities and the experiences  of Black disabled people, especially in regard to social services,  representation, social attitudes, violence and access to technology, we will be  better equipped to work together toward improving all of our lives. Black  disabled voices must be prioritized in this. And to do this, disability rights  communities must expand to recognize and value the experiences of those  with non-apparent and chronic disabilities such as asthma and diabetes,  which are overrepresented in communities of color. Indeed, as Black DS  grows, I believe it will deeply alter both disability studies and Black/Africana  studies as we know them.
