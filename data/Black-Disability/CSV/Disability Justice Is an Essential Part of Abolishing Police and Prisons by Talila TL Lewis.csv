" Disability Justice Is an Essential Part : of Abolishing Police and Prisons Ableism forms and informs violence, oppression, and incarceration, yet it  continues to be ignored by social justice movements  This article is part of  Abolition for the People , a series brought to you by a  partnership between Kaepernick Publishing and  LEVEL  a Medium publication for  and about the lives of Black and Brown men. The series, which comprises 30 essays  and conversations over four weeks, points to the crucial conclusion that policing  and prisons are not solutions for the issues and people the state deems social  problems — and calls for a future that puts justice and the needs of the community  first. hile it is well known that policing in the united states was originally  developed and later honed to control Black and Indigenous people’s lives — our  movement, labor, speech, ownership, family, and more — most are unaware  that disabled people (and those labeled disabled) have always been primary  among the carceral machine’s  intended targets . In fact, there is evidence  disabled people have the  most frequent and catastrophic encounters  with  carceral systems, and  ableism  has long been central to the nation’s economic,  political, legal, and social anatomy. Indeed, no social justice issue,  including  abolition , can be properly addressed without intentionally  centering disability  and ableism  — and no social justice movement can be successful without  disability justice at its heart. : ",ableism,oppression,disabled people,incarceration,abolition,disability justice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: The majority of society has come to understand disability through a lens of  whiteness, wealth, and other privileges that  actively exclude  the experiences of  Black/Indigenous and low- and no-income people. Importantly, those with  disabilities are disproportionately impacted by deprivation, violence and/or  precarity—and indeed, these environmental factors and socioeconomic  experiences are a  cause, complicator, and even consequence of disability . :  More importantly, one does not have to be disabled to experience ableism.  Rather,  ableism  is a systemic oppression that allows society, systems, and  individuals to assign value to people based on their appearance and their ability  to re/produce, excel, and behave. Ableism evaluates people on their divergence  (whether  actual or perceived ) from constructed ideas of normality, intelligence,  excellence, and productivity. In the united states, these constructions  are  necessarily rooted , as is the country itself, in anti-Blackness, anti- Indigeneity, misogyny, eugenics, colonialism, and capitalism.

" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: Still, most people in social justice movements are  unable to recognize ableism ,  and are unaware of just how ordinary yet lethal it is. But, policing,  incarceration and institutionalization, labor exploitation and impoverishment,  forced familial separation and deprivation of resources, climate and  environmental injustice, and other state and corporate violence  disproportionately affect disabled and other marginalized people while creating  and exacerbating disabilities.   Disability justice  is a requisite for  abolition  because carceral systems medicalize,  pathologize, criminalize, and  commodify  survival, divergence, and resistance.  The past and present connections between disability and all forms of carceral  violence are overt and overwhelming. Disabled/neurodivergent people  comprise  just 26%  of the united states population — but represent up to  half of  the people  killed by police,  over 50%  of the incarcerated adult prison  population,  up to 85% of the incarcerated youth population, and a significant  number of those incarcerated in  medicalized carceral spaces  like nursing  facilities, group facilities, and civil commitment, “treatment” facilities, and  “hospitals.” Whether under the pretense of “care” or “corrections,” disabled  people are highly represented in  all  carceral populations. History explains this  phenomenon. ",social justice,ableism,state violence,policing,institutionalization,incarceration,killed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: The united states government and corporations have always used constructed  ideas around disability and criminality alongside constructed ideas about class  and race to classify, criminalize, cage, and disappear its “undesirables.” In this  way, those in positions of power maintain the white supremacist status quo and  create an exploitable labor pool while sowing discord within and across  marginalized communities.

" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: For instance, mainstream doctors and scientists diagnosed Black enslaved  people who engaged in work stoppages, “property” destruction, or “ theft ”  with  dysaesthesia aethiopica , or “rascality”; similarly, mere thoughts of escaping  enslavement was dubbed  drapetomania . In both cases, these purported mental  illnesses could only be had by Black people, and could only be “cured” by yet  more unpaid hard labor and insufferable violence. Or take the  1880 census ’ “3D  schedule,” which described the so-called “ dependent, defective, and delinquent  classes ” using terms rooted in eugenics — now considered disability slurs — to  label people as: “idiots; insane inhabitants; deaf and dumb; blind; homeless  children; inhabitants in prisons; paupers and indigent inhabitants in  institutions, poor houses or asylums, or boarded at public expense in private  houses.” Forced  institutionalization/incarceration  and  sterilization  of people in  all of these “classes” was not uncommon, and  continues to this day  — with  carceral classifications premised on sex assigned at birth alone serving as a form  of eugenics of people labeled criminal and/or disabled.

" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: If this is not evidence enough, disenfranchisement of people with felony records  and people with disabilities can often be found within the  same section of law ,  the exclusion of one group often used to defend the exclusion of the other.   What many now call  collateral consequences  of incarceration — being barred  from voting or holding public office, even after release — are often still called  civil disabilities .” Modern  coronavirus criminalization ,  resisting arrest ,  and  disorderly conduct  laws, and police officers and unions using  pseudoscience diagnoses of  excited delirium  to defend murder all help  illuminate the unbroken chain between past and present carceral logics.

" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: These warped and circular logics are used to justify horrific exploitation,  experimentation, and extermination, and quell public outcry over what  otherwise would be deemed indefensible theft of dignity, life, and liberty. The  goal of incarceration has always been  civic , social, economic, and physical  marginalization and death of people who society deems unfit — the categories  of “unworthy” being so intentionally broad and intersected as to be endlessly  applicable. The nimble, timeless, and comprehensive nature of structural and  systemic oppression demonstrate that power holders deeply appreciate how  identities intersect and illustrate why intentionally intersectional responses to  state violence are necessary.

" Understanding Disability, Ableism, Policing, and Prisons: When abolitionists do not have a strong disability justice analysis, systems of  incarceration simply recategorize and redistribute people into other violent  carceral institutions for other manufactured reasons — often based on  purported health, criminality, and vulnerability. Knowing this, we are left no  choice but to  view carcerality much more broadly , through a disability justice  lens. If we fail to fill this gap in our collective consciousness, ableism will  continue to be used as an excuse for inflicting violence upon marginalized  people under the guise of care, treatment, and rehabilitation.

" The Difference Between Disability Rights and Disability : Justice Where  disability rights  seeks to change social conditions for some disabled  people via  law and policy , disability justice moves  beyond  law and policy: It  seeks to radically transform social conditions and norms in order to affirm and  support all people’s inherent right to live and thrive. All social justice  movements, then, must put the needs of disabled people — especially those at  the margins of the margins — front and center. This work begins with  unearthing and understanding the inextricable links between ableism and other  systems of oppression. :  Abolitionist movements must contend with how disability and ableism  interact  with  carceral systems, and be committed to abolishing  all  spaces to which  marginalized people are disappeared. Disability rights communities must begin  to practice  disability justice  and  disability solidarity , which demand a radical  reorientation of our collective understanding of systems of oppression especially  as related to disability, inter/dependence, and carcerality. And advocates for  any other form of racial, environmental, and economic justice must work to  understand how ableism interacts with racism, classism, and other oppressions  and violence to create, perpetuate, and exacerbate inequities.

" The Difference Between Disability Rights and Disability : Such a comprehensive approach would  challenge carcerality from its core . No  longer could arbitrary concepts of class, criminality, or disability serve as a  wedge between disability and abolitionists’ struggles — for they are one and  the same.

" The Difference Between Disability Rights and Disability : Like  transformative justice  and abolition, disability justice fundamentally alters  our approach to everything we think and do. It provides  meaningful and  necessary context  for marginalized people’s responses to their lived  experiences. It helps us politicize our disabilities,  love ourselves and others  more fully ,  creatively dismantle oppression , and uplift people who  are  perpetually marginalized  within our own communities and movements. It  honors  Black/Indigenous disabled wisdom , builds strong  care networks ,  and  develops  community/cultural health and healing workers. It helps  foreground the necessity of harm reduction and transformative justice, and  supplants punitive responses that find refuge in carceral logics and spaces. And  it develops the requisite  relationships , knowledge, and tools to help us practice  accountable advocacy across identities, communities, and movements.

" The Difference Between Disability Rights and Disability : Abolition depends on racial, economic, and healing justice — all of which  depend on disability justice. We have an opportunity to bring to the fore  experiences of a group that has largely been invisibilized in the abolition  movement. Now is the time to challenge dominant narratives about disability,  ableism, policing, and incarceration — to invite people to revisit everything  they think they know about these interlocking systems of oppression, and to  commit themselves to disability justice. Successful abolition strategies will  weave communities together by highlighting the ties between oppressions that  lead to seemingly intractable structural and systemic inequity.
