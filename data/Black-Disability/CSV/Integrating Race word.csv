" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : My critique of contemporary scholarship in feminist disability studies is that while it has  been extremely effective in foregrounding the limitations of the universalizing category  of “woman” that mainstream feminism continues to uphold (notwithstanding critiques  from poor women, lesbians, women of color, and third world women), it falls prey to its  own critique of normativity by failing to seriously engage “difference” within its own  ranks along the axes of race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, and national difference.  —Nirmala Erevelles (2011, 126)  Feminist disability studies is an area of scholarly inquiry that merges women’s, gender, and  feminist studies with disability studies. As the newer field, disability studies was influenced by  feminist theory. Prior to the coining of the term feminist disability studies, scholarship in this  area began to appear in the late 1980s with the bulk of the work focused on the lives of disabled  women.6 In the 1990s, publications began to directly engage and critique feminist theory and the  women’s movement, particularly the exclusion of disabled women and disability rights.7 In  1994, Garland-Thomson coined the term feminist disability studies in a review essay that  emphasizes the need for a feminist disability studies that includes but is not exclusively focused  on disabled women. In this article, Garland-Thomson names and defines the field by reviewing  work that “participates in the discourse of feminist disability studies without even announcing  itself as such” (1994, 592). This tactic is one we too use in our task of integrating race more  comprehensively into feminist disability studies today. : ",White Disability Studies,feminism,white,Disability Studies,disability rights,race,history,feminist disability studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : By the early 2000s, feminist disability studies had arrived. In 2001 and 2002 the feminist  philosophy journal Hypatia published a two-part special issue called “Feminism and Disability”  (Kittay, Silvers, and Wendell 2001, 2002). NWSA Journal quickly followed suit in 2002 with a  special issue titled “Feminist Disability Studies” (Hall 2002), which included Garland-  Thomson’s “Integrating Disability, Transforming Feminist Theory” (2002). Although Garland- Thomson published multiple pieces using the term feminist disability studies prior to 2002,  “Integrating Disability” is the piece that truly shaped the field. It has been reprinted in several  collections, cited over eight hundred times, and is taught regularly in disability studies courses.  More recently, the 2010s saw the publications of Hall’s edited collection Feminist Disability  Studies in 2011 and Hypatia’s special issue “New Con- versations in Feminist Disability  Studies” in 2015 (Hall 2011, 2015). In2017, the National Women’s Studies Association  established the Alison Piepmeier Prize for books in feminist disability studies, marking a clear  recognition of the establishment of the field.

" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : As we researched and wrote this brief history of feminist disability studies, we noted the limited  engagement with race as an analytic. While it is true that the scholars are mostly, though not  exclusively, white women, it is the focus of the arguments and citational practices that  foreground white- ness as the “constitutive underpinning” of the field (Bell 2006, 275). The  whiteness of feminist disability studies is perhaps unsurprising given the whiteness of disability  studies as a whole. And yet, feminist disability studies acknowledged the need for engagement  with race long before Chris Bell’s critique of “White Disability Studies” (2006). In the epilogue  to their edited collection Women with Disabilities, for example, Michelle Fine and Adrienne  Asch write, “Women of color who have disabilities are also under- represented in this volume.  For some, disability is their primary self-definition; for others it is not. How does race figure in a  woman’s experience of disability?” (1988a, 334). Similarly, Nasa Begum writes that “disabled  women can- not be treated as a unitary group,” insisting that we must consider race, class, and  sexuality, but ultimately she laments that “it is not possible within the ambit of this article to  provide this analysis” (Begum 1992, 70, 71). As shown, early feminist disability studies scholars  recognized the need for racial analysis but were frequently not able to do it.

" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : Despite early acknowledgments of the importance of race and calls for future scholarship to  better include racial analysis, however, feminist disability studies scholarship has primarily  entailed cursory or comparative inclusion of race with limited engagement with feminist-of-color  scholarship, even when such engagement is clearly warranted. For instance, Margaret Lloyd  (1992, 207) draws from “the history of black feminism” to propose an intersectional feminist  model of disability, yet her main citation for this theorization is white social policy scholar Fiona  Williams (1989) rather than the black feminist theorists Williams builds her work upon, such as  Hazel Carby, bell hooks, and Gloria Joseph. To take another example, despite mentioning  racialized examples of the intersections of gender and disability such as Sara Baartman, Julia  Pastrana, and Audre Lorde, Garland-Thomson’s “Integrating Disability” includes only two  feminists of color, Lorde herself and Toni Morrison, within its sixty-four total citations (Garland- Thomson 2002, 7, 9, 12).8 These examples illustrate how feminist disability studies  as tended to acknowledge the importance of race, typically by analogizing race and disability or  by drawing from the lessons and insights of feminist-of- color writing, without sustained critical  engagement with feminist-of-color scholarship and theorizing. While we do not wish to overstate  the limited treatment of race in feminist disability studies, we do want to emphasize the further  need for engagement with feminists of color as theorists in their own right. Our concern,  therefore, is primarily with the field’s approaches and citational politics. The largely deracinated  approach to feminist disability studies, we argue, has limited the investments, methods, and  interventions of the field.

" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : There are, of course, exceptions to the general whiteness of feminist dis- ability studies. Take,  for example, the 1993 special issue of Canadian Woman Studies on “Women and Disability”  (Blackford et al. 1993), which includes personal and academic essays by/on Native, Indonesian,  Salvadorian, Bangladeshi, and South Asian disabled women, or Alison Kafer’s intellectual  history of Donna Haraway’s cyborg in which Kafer explicitly acknowledges Haraway’s reliance  on feminists of color to theorize the cyborg and cites feminist- of-color responses to Haraway to  inform and improve disability studies critiques of cyborg theory (Kafer 2013, 103–28). These  exceptions unquestionably exist; however, they do not negate the overarching trends we have  identified across three decades.

" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : Our critique here builds on extant scholarship at the intersections of dis- ability, race, and gender.  In Disability and Difference in Global Contexts, Erevelles (2011) furthers what she terms a  “transnational feminist disability studies perspective,” through which she critiques both the  whiteness of feminist disability studies and the lack of critical engagement with disability in  transnational feminist and feminist-of-color scholarship. This framework situates disability,  gender, class, race, and sexuality within the broader trans- national context of colonialism and  neocolonialism. Notably, it highlights the absence of disability analysis (named as such) in “third  world feminist analyses of difference,” despite the disabling legacies of colonialism and the  ableism of the patriarchal postcolonial state (Erevelles 2011, 130). Erevelles, we contend, is  woefully undercited and underappreciated for her interventions in feminist disability studies.  More recently, Moya Bailey and Izetta Mobley have proposed a specifically black feminist  disability studies framework that takes black feminist scholarship as foundational to analyzing  the relationship of disability to race, gender, class, and sexuality (Bailey and Mobley 2018). Our  work here builds upon Erevelles, Bailey, and Mobley, and other feminists of color working in  disability studies in order to articulate a feminist-of-color disability studies umbrella framework  that both encompasses the existing work we cite throughout this article and provides a model for  producing future scholarship. We view feminist-of-color disability studies not as a replacement  for feminist disability studies or an addition but, as our title suggests, an element of the field that  must be integrated fully in order to transform it as a whole.

" A brief history of (white) feminist disability studies : We use the rest of this article to further theorize what it would mean to fully integrate race in  feminist disability studies. In “Integrating Disability,” Garland-Thomson lays out the parameters  of feminist disability studies, arguing for a universalizing rather than a minoritizing approach,  establishing the field’s fundamental theoretical premises, and identifying its central do- mains  (representation, the body, identity, and activism). Most importantly for our purposes, she argues:  “Integrating disability into feminist theory is generative, broadening our collective inquiries,  questioning our assumptions, and contributing to feminism’s intersectionality. Introducing a dis-  ability analysis does not narrow the inquiry, limit the focus only to women with disabilities, or  preclude engaging other manifestations of feminisms. . . . Integrating disability does not obscure  our critical focus on the registers of race, sexuality, ethnicity, or gender, nor is it additive. Rather,  considering disability shifts the conceptual framework to strengthen our understanding of how  these multiple systems intertwine, redefine, and mutually constitute one another” (Garland- Thomson 2002, 4). Similarly, we contend that integrating race into feminist disability studies is  generative and broadening, that it does not limit our sites of analysis to disabled women of color  nor preclude substantive engagement with sexuality, class, or other vectors of power. We argue  that for feminist disability studies to effectively improve our under- standing of intersecting and  mutually constitutive oppressions, it must take up feminist-of-color writing, activism, and theory,  which have long engaged issues of the body, illness, health, medicine, and disability in ways too  often excluded by the field to date.

" Theoretical frameworks: How to do feminist-of-color : disability studies  The methodology of disability studies involves scrutinizing not bodily or mental  impairments but the social norms that define particular at- tributes as impairments, as  well as the social conditions that concen- trate stigmatized attributes in particular  populations.  —Julie Avril Minich (2016)  Centering race in feminist disability analysis necessitates thinking beyond the politics of  recognition, representation, and identity that characterized early disability studies and instead  framing disability studies as a method. As the epigraph above suggests, this entails employing  disability studies as a lens to analyze the intersecting systems of ableism, heteropatriarchy, white  supremacy, and capitalist violence, particularly as they assign value or lack thereof to certain  bodyminds. It further requires questioning why certain topics—like fatness, HIV/AIDS, asthma,  or diabetes—are rarely considered under the rubric of disability studies and the ways in which  race and class determine the legibility of such topics within the field. Our understanding of  disability studies as method is first and foremost influenced by feminist- and queer-of-color  thought, but it also takes into account crip theory, all of which focus on methodological rather  than identitarian approaches. : ",Disability Studies,race,ableism,class,queer,feminist of color,,crip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Theoretical frameworks: How to do feminist-of-color : Feminist- and queer-of-color critiques, according to Grace Hong and Roderick Ferguson,  “profoundly question nationalist and identitarian modes of political organization and craft  alternative understandings of subjectivity, collectivity, and power.” As such, these fields of  inquiry refuse to cast race, gender, and sexuality as discrete entities, instead highlighting how the  “dividing line between valued and devalued” life cuts across and through identity categories  (Hong and Ferguson 2011, 2). Cathy Cohen, for instance, emphasizes the need for attention to  the “systematic relationship among forms of domination” (1997, 442), envisioning a queer  politics in which “one’s relation to [dominant] power, and not some homogenized identity, is  privileged in determining one’s political comrades” (438). Inspired by these interventions,  feminist-of-color disability studies likewise understands disability as a relationship to power  rather than a legible identity to which one can lay claim.  ",feminist of color,queer,race,gender,sexuality,power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Theoretical frameworks: How to do feminist-of-color : Following this, a feminist-of-color disability studies method highlights the ideological and  rhetorical deployment of ableism within legacies of eugenics, colonialism/neocolonialism,  counterterrorism, welfare reform, war, urban re- development, and other oppressive practices and  structures that route life- sustaining resources away from populations of color. More specifically,  it pays attention to the linkages between the ideologies of ability and the logics of gender and  sexual regulation that undergird racialized resource deprivation. This attunement to the workings  of power, that is, how ableist violence operates alongside and through heteropatriarchy,  capitalism, and white supremacy, further allows feminist-of-color disability studies to explore  unexpected points of affinity that might build coalition across categories. Like feminist- and  queer-of-color critique, a feminist-of-color disability analysis aims not to be additive—simply  layering disability on top of a laundry list of identities— but to demonstrate how disability is in  fact central to the gendered and sexual management of women and queers of color.  ",feminist of color,disability studies,ableism,power,oppression,capitalism,white supremacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Theoretical frameworks: How to do feminist-of-color : Feminist-of-color disability studies is also indebted to work in crip theory. Proposed as an  analogue to queer theory, crip theory takes a radical stance toward disability that attends to the  limitations and exclusions enacted by identity politics (McRuer 2006). Crip theorists shift focus  from a politicsof disability representation to the violent operations enabled through ideologies of  ability, or the implicit and often compulsory favoring of able- bodiedness and able-mindedness.  This attention to ideology proves useful for feminist-of-color disability studies, as work in crip  theory aids in articulating the mutual constitution of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, class-  ism, and cissexism and in tracing the raced, gendered, sexual, and classed nature of compulsory  able-bodiedness and able-mindedness. To be clear, while crip theory and feminist disability  studies frequently overlap, and many scholars include themselves in both intellectual endeavors,  they remain distinct, though complementary, political and methodological approaches. Feminist  disability studies has a much longer history and entails a critical approach to gender and  disability. Crip theory provides a newer theoretical lens to ex- amine disability beyond identity  or even embodiment, an approach informed by queer theory that doesn’t necessarily focus on  gender (though it often does). We contend that the methods offered by crip theory can be used  for better racial analysis in disability studies, but that does not mean that all crip theory  effectively engages with race.

" Theoretical frameworks: How to do feminist-of-color : Building upon both crip theory and feminist and queer-of-color critique, feminist-of-color  disability studies deploys disability studies as a lens that is not object- or identity-oriented,  moving us away from a politics of representation and toward an understanding of (dis)ability as a  social system and dis- ability as a relationship to power that intersects with and is mutually  constituted by race, gender, class, and sexuality. By situating disability within other overlapping  systems of domination, feminist-of-color disability studies also emphasizes coalition, affinity,  and solidarity. The domains identified in the remainder of this article showcase such possible  nodes of affinity, demonstrating the scope and purchase of this framework while envisioning  alternate lines of collectivity.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : disability studies  Given these theoretical foundations and frameworks, feminist-of-color dis- ability studies centers  different sites of analysis than feminist disability studies has traditionally encompassed. In  “Integrating Disability,” Garland- Thomson (2002) names the central domains of feminist  disability studies as representation, the body, identity, and activism. Building upon both Garland- Thomson’s structure and our discussion above, we propose that the central domains of feminist- of-color disability studies are discourse, state violence, health/care, and activism. In this section,  we explain why these sites of analysis are important for feminist-of-color disability studies and  discuss how this theoretical framework would operate in each domain. We provide brief  illustrative examples of work by feminists of color that engage in the intellectual project of  feminist-of-color disability studies even if that work does not name itself explicitly as disability  studies. We provide these examples to show feminist disability studies and feminist-of-color  theory scholars alike how such work can be understood as critical engagements with race,  gender, and (dis)ability in ways that are productive for both groups and both fields. : ",feminist of color,disability studies,feminist disability studies,state violence,healthcare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Discourse  Discourses of (dis)ability, that is, rhetoric about ability and disability encompassing discussions  of mental/physical fitness, normality and abnormality, and biological superiority, have been used  to create, maintain, and justify racial and gender hierarchies (and the various injustices and  violence that result from such hierarchies) in numerous ways across various historical moments.  Racialist science about black bodyminds being less susceptible to pain, more susceptible to  disease, and inherently in need of white care and control was used to justify black enslavement in  the United States (Boster 2013). Racialized and gendered discourses were also used by  residential boarding schools in regard to Native parents, especially mothers, who were  represented as dangerous transmitters of Native language and culture, which supposedly stunted  the intellectual, physical, and moral development of their children (Adams 1995; Jacobs 2009).  An early founder of such a school, Captain Richard H. Pratt, infamously used the phrase “Kill  the Indian in him, and save the man,” arguing that becoming “civilized” and speaking English  improved health and industriousness (Pratt 1892). In each of these examples discourses of  (dis)ability are fundamental to the operation of racism and sexism. By addressing discourses of  (dis)ability, feminist-of- color disability studies can expose “the ideology of ability in situations  that do not appear immediately to be about disability” (Minich 2014, 98). On a practical level  therefore, this first domain of feminist-of-color disability stud- ies allows us to (1) read these  moments as simultaneous instances of racism, sexism, and ableism; (2) refuse to collapse the  categories of race, gender, and (dis)ability while acknowledging their mutual constitution; (3)  trace and identify how these rhetorics fundamentally shape social norms and practices; and (4)  counter these oppressive discourses in solidarity with multiply marginalized populations.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Critical race and feminist scholars of the history of science and medicine and contemporary  health, science, and technology studies model ways to read the gendered and racial biases of  these cultural arenas, even when such biases are cloaked in the language of objectivity,  naturalness, or help. Scholarship in these areas reveals how the bodyminds of people of color,  women, and trans, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people are pathologized and marked  with discourses of disability even when such individuals are not legally, medically, or socially  recognized as disabled. Feminist-of-color dis- ability studies can bring the knowledge and  insights of disability studies to bear on these scholarly conversations, thereby marking these  fields as intimately connected to disability studies in ways not previously recognized. This  intellectual work is modeled in recent scholarship by Dorothy Roberts on race, gender, and  disability in contemporary reproductive technologies in which she explores the ways such  technologies are marketed as liberatory and progressive while actually perpetuating ableism,  racism, and misogyny (Roberts 2010; Roberts and Jesudason 2013).

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : As indicated in the domains section above, discourses of (dis)ability operate beyond/outside of  bodyminds and identity, yet they nonetheless result in striking social, political, and material  consequences for populations whose oppression and exclusion are justified through such  discourses. There are several existing examples of feminist-of-color disability studies scholar-  ship in this area.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : In Accessible Citizenship, Julie Avril Minich analyzes how discourses of disability and  metaphors of bodily integrity and health are used to frame discussions of nation, citizenship, and  immigration. In the United States, the nation is imagined “as a whole, nondisabled body whose  health must be protected from external pollutants” and internal threats to national well- being  (Minich 2014, 2). These nationalist discourses of (dis)ability shape not only immigration laws,  such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the 1882 Act to Regulate Immigration, but also  the treatment of immigrants, people read as immigrants (that is, people of color, especially those  with English as a second language), and other groups, such as disabled and poor people who are  considered burdens on the financial health of the nation (Stanley et al. 2013, 77). The rhetorical  use of disability and health within immigration debates and policies demonstrates how disability  dis- courses operate beyond disabled bodyminds alone and the need for scholars to grapple with  the entwinement of such discourses with race. Along these lines, Minich argues that “the fact  that the image of the unauthorized immigrant as a danger to the health of the national body  carries such rhetorical force is a direct result of the ideology of ability; it is because bodies  deemed unhealthy or disabled are seen as unsuited for political inclusion that the invocation of a  disease attacking the body politic is so effective at mobilizing anti-immigrant sentiment,” not  only in discussions of the US-Mexico border, the focus of Minich’s work, but also in histories of  immigration policy and in current immigration debates regarding refugees and immigrants from  predominantly Muslim countries as well (Minich 2014, 98).

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : In another example, in my own work, I, Jina B. Kim, detail how advocates of freeway expansion  in East Los Angeles used disability discourse and ableist metaphors to justify the freeways’  eventual displacement of mostly low-income people of color, especially Chicana/o people. I  write that “urban planners seized upon the medical language of blight” to represent “racialized  and low-income neighborhoods as diseased sites waiting for excision” from the supposedly  otherwise healthy body of the city (J. Kim 2017, 505). While the freeways were “cast in terms of  physical hyperability” to increase function, mobility, and cohesion for Los Angeles, the  neighbor- hoods and people impacted by the constructed were construed as disabling to the city  body politic (506). This (dis)ability discourse about freeways being enabling and good for the  city in contrast to low-income and racialized neighborhoods being disabling and damaging  allowed for the destruction of many communities, displacement of people, and an increase in  pollution and toxins via construction and freeway traffic in these areas. In this work I highlight  the environmental racism and “violence enacted through ostensibly neutral urban policy” and  critique “the racially uneven consequences of urban redevelopment and disproportionate toxic  load borne by racialized communities” with strong attention to disablement and women of color  (512).

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : As these examples show, discourse never remains exclusively in the realm of ideology or  language alone. Instead, discourse justifies and shores up structural power relations, leading to  eventual material impact on marginalized people, such as harsh immigration policies and ill  treatment of immigrants or the displacement of poor and racialized populations into  neighborhoods subjected to increased amounts of environmental toxins. Discourses of dis-  ability, therefore, have real effects on women and people of color’s body- minds regardless of  their disability identity or status, most often through the creation of structural exclusion, neglect,  and other forms of state violence, the second domain of feminist-of-color disability studies.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : State violence  Due to the disabling impact of state violence, a feminist-of-color disability studies must go  beyond an identity-based approach, which often centralizes the attainment of legal rights, such as  those provided by the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the United States’ first  comprehensive civil rights law for disabled people. This law is often credited with ushering dis-  ability studies into the academy, and its conceptualization of disability initially shaped scholarly  discussions of disability in favor of an identitarian model of minority difference centering  questions of representation, legibility, and inclusion. Yet as Dean Spade and others have argued,  rights-based platforms implicitly frame the nation-state as a site of protection, effectively erasing  those members of the population who are regularly subject to state violence (Spade 2011). As  such, these platforms tend to primarily benefit the most elite occupants of any given identity  category while prioritizing assimilation into dominant institutions.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Instead of centering state-sanctioned understandings of disability, feminist-of-color disability  studies would prioritize considerations of state violence attending to the intersection of disability  politics with abolitionist and anticarceral frameworks. State apparatuses—prisons, police,  schools, and welfare systems—rarely support the most precarious classes of people and, in fact,  regularly brutalize those who are poor, undocumented, black, brown, dis- abled, trans, and/or  gender nonconforming. Such apparatuses often operate as themselves instruments of mass  disablement that disproportionately target black and brown populations.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Since at least the 1970s, the United States has witnessed the expansion of the carceral and  punitive arms of the state alongside the retraction of welfare. The 1950s and 1960s ushered in the  deinstitutionalization of state care, during which unprecedented numbers of disabled people in  state- run psychiatric institutions became reliant on informal or community-based service  networks and further at risk of police abuse.10 In this revised land- scape of state containment  and neglect, disability functions as both a primary rationale for and a target of violence. As  reported in the anthology Disability Incarcerated, “race and disability play a significant role in  incarceration rates . . . more than half of all prison and jail inmates were reported to have a  mental health problem” (Chapman, Carey, and Ben-Moshe 2014, 13). Further, for women, trans,  and gender-nonconforming people of color, “police responses to mental health crises make up a  significant proportion of . . . lethal encounters with police” (Ritchie 2017, 91). Indeed, the  majority of people subjected to police violence are categorized as mentally or physically dis-  abled, as actual or perceived disability has long motivated police violence against people of  color. Such subjects are more likely to be viewed as out of control, deranged, or mentally  unstable, and such traits are more likely to be met with excessive force for racialized subjects  (Schalk 2018, 79–82).

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : In addition to foregrounding disability in analyses of the carceral state, a feminist-of-color  disability studies would broaden conversations around state-sanctioned violence beyond the  usual suspects. Cohen argues that feminism, particularly black feminism, prompts us to ask,  “what are the other examples of state violence or state oppression that we need to be paying  attention to? . . . While there is a normative model of who we think about as the victim of state  violence, which is often a heterosexual man in a confrontation with police, we know that state  oppression manifests not only in that model. . . . It happens through the denial of state welfare  assistance, and it happens in the ways we militarize the public schools that primarily black,  Latino, and poor kids attend” (Cohen and Jackson 2016, 776). Building on these claims, a  feminist-of-color disability framework underscores how ideologies of ability shape less visible  processes of state violence such as antiwelfare policy, the school-to-prison pipeline, and  infrastructural neglect.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Alongside antiblackness, anti-immigrant sentiment, and misogyny, dis- courses of disability and  disease also gave narrative traction to antiwelfare policies such as the 1996 Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). As Sanford F. Schram  observes, PRWORA contributed considerably to the “medicalization” of welfare, as the act  “helped accelerate the tendency to construct welfare dependency as an ill- ness, thereby  transforming welfare reform into a set of therapeutic interventions designed to cure people of a  malady” (2000, 59). Further, the bogey- men of welfare reform—the so-called welfare queen, the  undocumented migrant, and the disabled subject—were collectively imagined as drains on public  resources and therefore disabling to the nation writ large. The welfare queen, for instance,  demonstrates the cooperation of ableist reasoning along- side racialized sexual regulation.  Feminist-of-color disability studies can make evident how this figure becomes legible through  discourses of (dis)ability: she is defined as an incapable mother, a social aberrancy to be  rehabilitated through workfare programs.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Turning to the militarization of public schools, critical race disability scholars have observed  how the medical model of disability, combined with zero-tolerance policies, has  disproportionately funneled black and brown students toward special education classrooms and  alternative schools and how both function as precursors to (and outposts of) the prison-industrial  complex (Erevelles 2014; Annamma 2017). In these spaces, Erevelles writes, “definitions of  disability as intransigent pathology are used to justify segregation along the axes of race and  class under the questionable guise of ‘special’ education and rehabilitation” (2014, 93). Here  feminist-of-color disability studies can highlight how both antiwelfare policy and the school- to- prison pipeline instrumentalize the specter of disability in order to with- hold life-sustaining  resources from low-income and racialized communities. Further, in refusing to frame disability  as pathology and challenging the ableist ideals of independence and productivity at the core of  these punitive processes, feminist-of-color disability studies can also refute the collective  ideological operations of ableism, racism, sexism, and classism upon which these processes turn.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Finally, a feminist-of-color disability studies would foreground state- sanctioned slow violence,  such as infrastructural abandonment, that dis- proportionately produces disabling and/or  debilitating conditions for com- munities of color.11 Rob Nixon defines slow violence as that  which “occurs gradually and out of sight . . . an attritional violence that is typically not viewed as  violence at all” (Nixon 2011, 2). This mode of violence is operational in events such as the Flint  water crisis. In Flint, the shifting of the city water source from the treated Detroit Water and  Sewerage Department to the corrosive Flint River—a choice driven by state austerity measures  and emergency management—resulted in widespread lead contamination. The crisis, which  generated a public health state of emergency that continues to this day, demonstrates how  disability is all too often a racialized process and historical event embedded in social, economic,  and environmental inequities.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Within the domain of state violence, therefore, feminist-of-color disability studies attends not  only to the direct violence of policing and incarceration but also to the slow violence targeting  racialized populations through processes of state neglect as well as the ways in which health/care  systems then manage the fallout of such processes. Feminist-of-color disability stud- ies can also  highlight the entanglements between state-sanctioned slow vi- olence and systems of state care,  where violence and care often become in- separable. For these reasons, we turn to health/care as  our third domain.  ",state violence,healthcare,policing,prison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Health/care  While disability rights activists have fought for a reduction of the role of doctors and  medical/health specialists in their lives, feminist and antiracist health activists have historically  had to fight for, first, access to medical care, such as in the black hospital movement and the  women’s clinic movement, and, second, for improved quality of care, that is, health care free  from racial, gendered, sexual, and (dis)ability discrimination.12 As a result, feminist- of-color  disability studies must take a critical and expansive approach to health/care as one of its central  domains. Of course, disability rights activists have long challenged the dehumanizing and ableist  medical treatment of disabled people. Feminist disability studies scholars in particular, especially  those working on chronic pain and mental disability, have been prominent in acknowledging the  need to rethink the rejection of the medical industrial complex, adjusting approaches to the social  model of disability, which was developed primarily by white heterosexual men with permanent,  stable physical disabilities (Wendell 2001; Price 2015).

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Feminist-of-color disability studies can further these arguments by taking into account cultural  and religious perspectives on wellness and healing, which may run counter to mainstream white  disability studies as well as West- ern white medical perspectives on these issues.14 For instance,  a feminist-of- color disability studies approach can allow for a culturally attuned race, gender,  and disability analysis of women-of-color wellness initiatives and organizations like Black  Women’s Wellness Day or the National Latina Health Organization, which seek to improve the  overall health and wellness of specific racial communities through culturally specific public  health initiatives. Such an approach would nuance any critique of the ableism common in public  health work generally with attention to specific racial-gendered histories and circumstances that  shape the discourses and practices of these race-specific health organizations.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Feminist-of-color disability studies can expand and complicate how we engage with health,  medicine, and what Akemi Nishida calls “the U.S. public healthcare assemblage” (Nishida  2017). This assemblage includes not only disabled people receiving long-term care services  (often through Medicaid and other state services) but also in-home care workers (who are pre-  dominantly poor, working class, and/or immigrant women of color) and the agencies that employ  them. A feminist-of-color disability studies approach to the US public health-care assemblage  would nuance existing feminist studies work on the feminization of care and existing feminist  disability studies work on care relationships for the disabled through attention to the race, class,  and citizenship status of health/care workers. As modeled in Nishida’s work, feminist-of-color  disability studies can balance attention to disabled people’s rights to quality care, life in their  own communities, and interdependence with critical, intersectional consideration of the lives of  health/care workers whose physical labor can be debilitating. Such an approach to the US public  health-care assemblage would remain staunchly critical of the social and political structures that  exacerbate the vulnerability of disabled people and poor and immigrant women of color, making  solidarity and coalition between these groups difficult.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Overall, health and health care within feminist-of-color disability studies must be understood  expansively and analyzed within the contexts of race, gender, (dis)ability, sexuality, class, and  citizenship status. This includes discussion of the health/care provider and recipient relationships  mentioned above as well as the histories of medical experimentation on people of color and  eugenics directed at disabled, poor, and nonwhite people. For many marginalized groups,  approaches to medicine and health/care have always been directly tied to antiracist and feminist  activism for the overall well- being and survival of a particular group. Activism, therefore, is the  fourth and final central domain of feminist-of-color disability studies.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Activism  Our final domain mirrors the conclusion of Garland-Thomson’s (2002) essay, which similarly  closes with a meditation on disability activism. We con- tend that a feminist-of-color disability  studies aligns itself with radical organizing and cultural production conducted under the banner  of disability justice. Disability justice, according to Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha, names  a “movement building framework of intersectional, revolutionary dis- ability politics” (2018).  Feminist-of-color disability studies ought to high- light and center writing, action, and organizing  that operate from a disability justice perspective.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Several histories of the disability rights movement present disability activism as a teleological  narrative, with the 1990 passage of the ADA serving as that narrative’s apex (Shapiro 1994;  O’Brien 2004; Davis 2015). This momentous piece of legislation was the hard-won result of  decades of protest by individuals and organizations like ADAPT (American Disabled for  Accessible Public Transit), which continues disability rights activism in the present via protests  against the so-called American Health Care Act in 2017, which aimed to partially repeal the  Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. However, histories of disability rights  organizing render evident the white- ness of leadership in this wave of disability rights activism.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : In response to a white-dominated disability movement, an increasing number of voices have  articulated the necessity of disability activism less centered on state legislation. As Mia Mingus  writes, “I want us to tap into the transformative powers of disability, instead of only gaining  access to the cur- rent system. . . . We don’t simply want to join the ranks of the privileged, we  want to challenge and dismantle those ranks and question why some people are consistently at  the bottom” (2017). Indeed, Mingus, Piepzna- Samarasinha, and others like Leroy Moore, Patty  Berne, Eli Clare, Stacy Milbern, and Nomy Lamm have come to understand the disability rights  movement as primarily geared toward “gaining access to the current system” (Mingus 2017).  While these organizers note that “the disability rights movement has been crucial to the  liberation of people with disabilities,” they have called for a movement attuned to structural  oppression and multiply marginalized populations, one that challenges the capitalist ideals of  independence and productivity at the core of rights-based reforms (Lamm 2015). These activists,  artists, and intellectuals insist on a movement that decenters those who can gain access to rights  through a legal-based framework. They call this new framework disability justice. Feminist-of- color disability studies aligns politically and intellectually with this approach, allowing disability  justice activism to inform feminist-of-color disability studies scholarship.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : For proponents of disability justice, ableism is inextricable from white supremacy, patriarchy,  heterosexism, transphobia, colonialism, and poverty. As a result, disability justice is an activist  framework that centers the experiences of queer, trans, and/or racialized disabled people. The  groundbreaking publication Skin, Tooth, and Bone, collectively authored by Bay Area activist  and performance group Sins Invalid, lays out a working (and evolving) definition of disability  justice as well as its ten central principles: intersectionality, leadership of the most impacted,  anticapitalist politic, cross-movement solidarity, recognizing wholeness, sustainability,  commitment to cross-disability solidarity, interdependence, collective access, and collective  liberation (Sins Invalid 2016, 16–19). This framework imagines a disability movement that  radically revises what revolution looks like and that offers a blueprint for survival in our current  moment of crisis.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : What does this blueprint look like? It might look like a 2008 Sins Invalid performance, in which  Cara Page, black queer cofounder of the healing jus- tice collective Kindred, pulls a scroll of  ableist slurs from the mouth of black disabled performer Leroy Moore, corralling their power  through her forceful reading and sensual touch. Or it might look like “Open in Emergency,” the  Asian American Literary Review’s 2017 special issue on mental health, which contains both a  hacked DSM, which speaks back to white supremacist psychiatry, and a tarot deck, which offers  alternate, artistic, and culturally at- tuned paths to healing and wellness (Khu´c 2016). Or more  broadly, it might spell out a complete overhaul of what the work of revolution even entails. For  instance, in “A Babelicious Healing Justice Statement,” the disability justice– centered BadAss  Visionary Healers prioritize basic access and care needs, such as food, child care, and  transportation, insisting that this access work is “not separate from the real work” (BadAss  Visionary Healers 2013, 7). The disability justice perspective prioritized by feminist-of-color  disability studies thus provokes reflection on the labor of revolution itself, prompting us to  question why and how value accrues to certain forms of activist labor and to see the work of  care, maintenance, and access as central to social change.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : This blueprint further necessitates disability justice interventions into political organizing by  people of color. Following the publication of the Movement for Black Lives’ political platform,  the Harriet Tubman Collective, a group of Black disabled and Deaf organizers, released a  statement addressing the platform’s inattention to disability—a concerning omission considering  “the unspeakable violence found at the intersection of ableism, audism, and anti-black racism”  (Harriet Tubman Collective 2016). A disability justice framework also intervenes into the  seemingly intractable problem of inaccessible organizing, in which the work of activism all too  often looks like “10-mile long marches [and] workshops that urge people to ‘get out of their seats  and move!’” (Piepzna-Samarasinha 2018). Feminist-of-color disability approaches to studying  activism as a central domain or site of analysis, therefore, require us to recalibrate governing  notions of activist labor, to address racism within disability activism and ableism within  antiracist activism, and to shift our understanding of what constitutes intellectual labor and  publication, as the majority of the citations in this section come from self-published and/ or  digital open-access sources. Feminist-of-color disability studies requires us to honor the  knowledge, skills, and wisdom of multiply marginalized disabled people. After all, in the words  of Mingus, “there is no liberation with- out disabled people” (2017).

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Onward  Feminist-of-color disability studies is an emergent field in that only a few scholars explicitly  situate their work at the intersection of disability studies, critical race studies, and feminist  theory. And yet, feminists of color have an extended history of researching and theorizing  (dis)ability broadly construed, offering invaluable but overlooked insights for feminist disability  studies. The whiteness embedded in the history of feminist disability studies has shaped the field  in significant and, we contend, limiting ways. First, since many feminist disability studies  scholars primarily or predominantly cite theory by and about white people, this has negatively  impacted the field’s ability to analyze the writing, history, and experiences of people of color.  Second, since white and middle-class views and experiences of disability have shaped how  feminist disability studies approaches the concept of disability, the field has been unable to  properly recognize and engage with the extended history of feminist-of-color writing and  theorizing about health, illness, and medicine as feminist disability studies work.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : In this article we have engaged existing feminist-of-color work on (dis)ability to articulate  feminist-of-color disability studies’ primary methods (ideology- rather than object-orientation,  focus on [dis]ability as a system and disability as a relation to power rather than as identity, and  emphasis on solidarity and coalition across social groups) and domains (discourse, state violence,  health/care, and activism). We urge feminist disability studies scholars to cite more widely in  feminist-of-color theory, recognizing that much feminist-of-color work on (dis)ability never uses  the word disability at all but rather refers to specific impairments or focuses on health, illness,  disease, well- ness, and medicine in the context of a sexist and racist world. At the same time, we  encourage feminists of color to more directly and explicitly engage the field of feminist disability  studies in order to better analyze issues of (dis)ability from an explicitly politicized and  antiableist perspective.

" Domains and sites of analysis: Where to do feminist-of-color : Our work here has been to identify potential sites of analysis and opportunities for cross- pollination between feminist-of-color scholarship and feminist disability studies. This work has  required creative collaboration to envision the range of what feminist-of-color disability studies  might entail, combining our distinct areas of expertise and experience as disabled and non-  disabled queer women of color working in the fields of feminist disability studies and critical  race theory. Given our bases in US feminist-of-color scholarship, we want to emphasize that, in  addition to the areas we have identified, future feminist-of-color disability studies work needs to  engage transnational and postcolonial perspectives. We also see great potential for feminist-of-  color disability studies to contribute to the history of science and medicine and to contemporary  science and technology studies in particular. We hope this article provides the foundation  necessary for future feminist-of-color dis- ability studies scholarship in a variety of disciplines  that would benefit from this emergent field’s vital perspectives on the roles of race, gender, and  (dis)ability in our past, our present, and our futures.
