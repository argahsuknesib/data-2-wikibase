" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Legislation Is Life Threatening  FOSTA and SESTA claim to target websites that could be used for  trafficking. In reality, they have restricted the ability of consensual sex  workers to advertise their services, which has led to a decrease in income  and safety—and disabled sex workers are feeling the strain particularly hard. :  Before Freya Wynn entered the sex industry, she worked as a custodian for  an urban school district.  Wynn lives with a “right lung glued in place” as a result of “a spontaneous  hemopneumothorax/tension pneumo[nia] six years ago.” She also has  several undiagnosed, but nevertheless disabling, conditions. “I’ve gone in  to work on a chipped hip before, I’ve gone into work on a collapsed lung  before,” she told  Rewire News .

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Her employer limited her hours, so she didn’t qualify for health insurance.  Meanwhile, she watched “co-workers suffer from celiacs, diabetes, and then  be disposed [of].”  “It was the only thing available to me,” Wynn said of her custodial job. “I  know I’d sooner be worked into dust than [be] given a chance at a decent  living.”  Or, at least, that was was she thought before she became a porn actress and  an escort. As an escort, she said, “I can choose my own hours. I can work  from home.” Her appearances as a porn actress have won an  Adult Video  News award , which recognizes achievements in the adult entertainment  industry. Sex work, Wynn said, has accommodated her disabilities better  than employment that locked her into a tight routine, particularly because  her “chronic pain ebbs and flows and follows no schedule.” She appreciates  that disability-related shifts in capacity are something she can “work  around with sex work.”  “I just wanted to survive,” she said.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : In recent months, however, Wynn has started to face difficulties in the sex  work industry as well, thanks to new federal legislation. Earlier this year,  U.S. Congress passed  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act  (FOSTA) and  Stop  Enabling Sex Traffickers Act  (SESTA). The laws claim to target websites that  could potentially be used for trafficking. In reality, they have restricted the  ability of consensual sex workers to advertise their services, which in turn  has led to a decrease in income and safety—and disabled sex workers, like  Wynn, are feeling the strain particularly hard.   Disabled people like Wynn experience poverty and job discrimination at  uniquely high rates. This is due to a variety of factors, including stigma,  structural ableism in the workplace, and rising medical costs. Some  disabled adults are also subject to labor rules that allow them to be paid  significantly less than non-disabled people in similar positions. This  subminimum wage ” is based on the assumed productivity of disabled  workers. The bottom of the scale is difficult to ascertain, but these workers,  many of them employed within  sheltered workshops , can make less than  one dollar an hour.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : In 2016, the last year statistics are available,  26.6 percent of non- institutionalized disabled adults lived below the poverty line , as opposed to  12.7 percent of the U.S. population overall. The  median household income  for families that contained at least one disabled person of working age  was  $43,300 as opposed to the $59,039 median household income that same  year,  according to the United States Census Bureau . These numbers vary  slightly by type of disability, but are uniformly higher than average. For  cognitively disabled people, the poverty rate is over 32 percent.  Meanwhile, federal and state disability benefits come with income caps that  exclude some disabled people from working on the books. That’s if  individuals are able to receive benefits at all: Between 2000 and 2010,  only  28 percent of applicants were approved for disability  benefits the first time  they applied.  ",poverty,disabled people,benefts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : For disabled people who are unable to secure benefits because their  condition or symptoms fall out of the scope of federal care, the financial  strain can be unbearable. Approval rates for federal disability benefits differ  vastly by condition, severity, and state. And without documentation of  disability, workers can be fired from their jobs for issues arising from their  disability. Others are forced to hide the disabling symptoms of their  conditions in order to stay employed.  ",disabled people,benefits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : And those who are able to obtain government assistance may find it doesn’t  stretch far enough to allow a disabled person to live comfortably without  additional income. Sex work is sometimes the only option to make the  exorbitant amount of money medical bills and other living expenses require  with relative speed, without waiting for reimbursement or approval.  Medical assistance, food stamps, and other government benefits can be  maintained while bringing in cash under the table. Sex work can also be a  way for disabled people to work out of their own homes if necessary, or  only when they are able.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Overall, sex work can be a way for disabled people to cope with the  financial realities of an imperfect system.   While some forms of sex work are criminalized, others are completely  legal—such as stripping, webcam modeling, and appearing in  pornography. Unfortunately, both legal and illegal forms of sex work have  been affected by FOSTA and SESTA, and sex workers have been  endangered as a result.  Instagram scrubbed its search bar clean of the  #stripper hashtag ,  Bank of America has frozen the accounts of suspected  sex workers , and  sites that host lists of violent or disrespectful clients have  been shut down , in addition to the removal of Craiglist’s personals section  and Backpage.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Spaces that allowed sex workers to advertise online  made  the industry  safer. Without access to these services, the most marginalized sex workers,  including disabled sex workers, are punished. FOSTA and SESTA makes  clients nervous about prosecution, they say, and the shrinking client pool  could be driving down service prices and forcing providers to offer services  they otherwise would not.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Wynn, for example, is now feeling the financial strain and uncertainty that  the recent federal legislation has begun to cause. “I’ve just been continually  trying to dig myself out of a position I swear I could have readily climbed  out of in the context and material situation of years past, but it seems and  feels that my luck has now run dry,” said Wynn, who is currently  unhoused. “I just feel like I’m against the wall.”  Some sex workers also fear that the laws could be used to prosecute them  for trafficking or other crimes, even if they are not participating in illegal  forms of sex work.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Ginger is a sex worker living with physical and cognitive disabilities as well  as mental illness. They are a part-time user of mobility devices. “I limp, but  it’s not there all the time,” Ginger explained. “I don’t look disabled.”  Ginger, who did not complete high school, told  Rewire News  they’ve had  “trouble finding other forms of employment” outside of sex work.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Ginger started trading sex for housing after being kicked out of their  parents’ house just before their 18th birthday. They began appearing in  porn and later found work within the sex industry through Craigslist’s  now-extinct “erotic services” section. Ginger receives temporary disability  payments allocated by the state as they wait for their  Supplemental Security  Income  application to be approved. They worry those benefits will be  threatened in light of the increased scrutiny on sex workers and their clients  that may come with FOSTA and SESTA.  “Those of us on federal benefits have a greater worry when it comes to  hiding money. SSA is authorized to check our financial accounts. They can  check anything linked to our Social Security numbers,” Ginger  told  Rewire.News .  “I am reliant on the system. If I get caught in anything I lose everything and  I can’t go back. I know a lot disabled sex workers are in the same position,”  Ginger said.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Rae, a white nonbinary person, uses sex work to pay the costs associated  with their disabilities. They are also among the vast majority of sex workers  interviewed for this story who reported having experienced  domestic  violence, child abuse, or intimate partner violence .  “I’ve had medical bills piling up that I am paying off. I also have credit debt  from leaving my abusive home life and over $100k in student loans,” Rae  told  Rewire News .   Rae says that FOSTA and SESTA have increased the likelihood of  workplace violence for full-service sex workers like them. “I am more afraid  than ever of being caught or killed by a cop that poses as a john, or a john  that wants to blackmail me with these new laws. I started taking more  chances when FOSTA/SESTA were passed,” they said. Rae said increased  client pressure in the wake of these laws has led them to meet clients more  quickly, screen them less thoroughly, and engage in riskier activities.

" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : Rae, like several of the other workers interviewed, said that FOSTA and  SESTA perpetuates and facilitates violence against sex workers. “Many sex  workers are unable to get new clients, meaning they are forced to keep  clients who may be abusive,” they told  Rewire News .  “I have had to get more creative and less picky about clientele. I rush more  when I find someone who is actually willing to meet and not waste my  time,” Wynn explained. “I show my face or other identifying pictures more  easily to obtain more clientele, which is dangerous for my identity.”  “The people I know are panicking,” Ginger stressed. “I’ve been watching  people scramble to change the services they provide and the language  around them. They’ve had to change everything around. Their income has  seriously decreased. They haven’t been making ends meet. It makes things  a lot more precarious than they would be any way.”  The irony of FOSTA and SESTA is that human trafficking, in the sex  industry and other cash-dominant industries, existed long before digital  services such as Backpage. In many ways, the fear and precarity the laws  force on consensual sex workers is likely to make more than a few turn to  predatory agencies and pimps. By taking advantage of the public’s fear of  sex trafficking, celebrities and politicians such as Amy Schumer and Sen.  Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) may have believed they were helping women.  Instead, they have exposed a workforce composed predominantly of  women to additional danger and uncertainty.  ",FOSTA,SESTA,sex worker,impact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : In fact, Maizea, a sex worker of mixed heritage who started trading sex at  age 11 to escape a sexually abusive home, believes that politicians and  celebrities who claim to be feminists only care about trafficking when  convenient, while people in the sex industry and sex trade prevent and  undermine trafficking every day. For instance, sex workers had previously  used sites to share information about potentially dangerous clients, some of  whom were pimps and traffickers. FOSTA and SESTA took many of the bad  client lists and spaces where sex workers shared safety tips offline. Without  these resources, consensual sex workers are left with less protection than  before.  “Who cares about us but us? Who lifts us up? Who goes through ads and  realizes we’re being pimped out or trafficked? Who feeds us emotionally as  well as literally? Who really gives a shit and is willing to do something  about it? [Sex workers] are!” Maizea wrote to  Rewire News .  ",sex worker,FOSTA,SESTA,feminist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" For Disabled Sex Workers, Congress’ Anti-Trafficking : In the wake of these violent laws, sex workers—disabled and able- bodied alike—are building networks of support to counteract the  legislation’s ill effects. Sex worker-led  organizing ,  advocacy ,  and  fundraising  has flourished as a result of FOSTA/SESTA, much of it  explicitly inclusive of disabled sex workers.  “Sex Workers, ill or not, need to take [care] of each other because we will  die without each other. It isn’t enough to say we deserve to live and  survive; we deserve decriminalization,” Maizea said.  ",sex worker,disabled people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
