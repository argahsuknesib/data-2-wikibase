" Introducing White Disability Studies  : A Modest Proposal  Chris Bell  My modest proposal is inspired by a popular television program airing on the Chicago PBS  affiliate. “Check, Please!” gathers three “ordinary” residents who, after selecting their favorite  restaurant, anonymously dine at all three establishments, then gather in a studio to debate the  relative merits and shortfalls of each culinary venue. During one episode, the trio included a self- styled bon vivant whom I will call Dorian Gray. Dorian, while sharing his observations about a  Chinese restaurant in a south Chicago suburb, expressed his unadulterated amazement at the  composition of one particular entre´e. “The shrimp were artificial!” he bemoaned, dread  contorting his facial features into an expression of unrecoverable distress. The individual  selecting said restaurant as his favorite—I’ll call him Bubba Gump—blinked nary an eye at this  revelation. Instead, Bubba stoically intoned, “If it looks like a shrimp, and it smells and tastes  like a shrimp, it’s a shrimp.”  Bubba Gump’s matter-of-fact rejoinder to Dorian Gray is, I think, indicative of the whiteness of  Disability Studies in its present incarnation. The fact that Disability Studies is marketed as such  when it is in actuality an artificial (read: limited and limiting) version of the field does nothing to  prevent it from being understood as Disability Studies, which is what Bubba, by extension,  apprised Dorian of. I contend that it is disingenuous to keep up the pretense that the field is an  inclusive one when it is not. On that score, I would like to concede the failure of Disability  Studies to engage issues of race and ethnicity in a substantive capacity, thereby entrenching  whiteness as its constitutive underpinning. In short, I want to call a shrimp a shrimp and  acknowledge Disability Studies for what it is, White Disability Studies. : ",whiteness,Disability Studies,race,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Introducing White Disability Studies  : In contradistinction to Disability Studies, White Disability Studies recognizes its tendency to  whitewash disability history, ontology and phenomenology. White Disability Studies, while not  wholeheartedly excluding people of color from its critique, by and large focuses on the work of  white individuals and is itself largely produced by a corps of white scholars and activists. White  Disability Studies envisions nothing ill-advised with this leaning because it is innocently done  and far too difficult to remedy. A synoptic review of some of the literature and related aspects of  Disability Studies bears this out.  ",White Disability Studies,history,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “Vital Signs: Crip Culture Talks Back” : This documentary was filmed during a conference on Disability and the Arts on the campus of  the University of Michigan. The film is distressing because of its absence of non-white  individuals. Given the absence of people of color, I suggest that a significant number of myths  and misconceptions about who/what is constitutive of disability or “crip” culture are bolstered  and reinforced in the film. : ",disability,crip,whiteness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement : In his introduction, author Joseph Shapiro refers to the disabled community as the largest  minority community in the United States, with more members than communities tallied by race,  ethnicity, or sexual orientation amongst other socially-constructed identity categories. What  interests me is Shapiro’s obfuscation of divisions within this ostensibly-largest minority  community and his insinuation that the disabled community is a monolithic one, struggling  against the same oppressors, striving for identical degrees of dignity, recognition and cultural  representation. Such a characterization is a limited one that does not consider or address the rich  diversity within disability communities—racial and ethnic diversity, for example. : ",disability,race,community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Matter of Dignity: Changing the Lives of the Disabled : Comprised of a series of interviews with disabled people from various life strata, the dearth of  people of color in the text is as undeniable as it is flagrant. In order to prevent this text from  surprising the unexpecting reader, it might be a good idea to acknowledge that whiteness is  positioned as its center. Doing so would make for a much more accurate description of who/what  is represented. : ",disabled people,whiteness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity : In her well-known text, Simi Linton describes Disability Studies by stating, “The field explores  the critical divisions our society makes in creating the normal versus the pathological, the insider  versus the outsider, or the competent citizen versus the ward of the state”. The reader should  recognize the dichotomous line of thought here, the binary fashion with which Linton makes her  critique. At the very least, it should be understood that many white disabled people have cultural  capital by virtue of their race and are, therefore, more on the inside than they are on the outside.  As an insider, Linton appears unaware of her positioning, and it is that unawareness that is one of  the hallmarks of White Disability Studies. : ",Disability Studies,white,race,White Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Enforcing Normalcy: Disability, Deafness and the Body : Throughout this text, Davis takes whiteness as a norm. From his discussion of the desirability of  the Venus de Milo to his examination of the protagonist in “Born on the Fourth of July,” Davis’s  emphasis on whiteness is undeniable. There is, to be sure, nothing wrong with this focus (aside  from being egregiously misleading with regard to which communities and subjectivities are  constitutive of “disability”). I only wish Davis had broadened his source materials, or at the very  least opted for a more accurate title e.g., Enforcing Normalcy: Disability, Deafness and the  White Body. Moreover, it matters that an excerpt from this text is reprinted in The Norton  Anthology of Literary Criticism, the ostensible Bible of literary studies. Those readers coming  across this excerpt will necessarily receive a distorted view of Disability Studies as a result of  Davis’s focus on whiteness. : ",whiteness,disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Queer Disability Conference : Near the conclusion of the first day of this conference that convened in San Francisco in June  2002, I met with approximately thirteen other self-identified queer and disabled people of color  during a caucus session. Our conversation focused on our individual and collective sense of  exclusion based on race and ethnicity.2 We could not fathom how the conference organizers— every one of them a white person—could publicize this conference in numerous international  contexts and venues—drawing participants from Finland, Australia, and the United Kingdom  among other nations—but fail to devise and implement an outreach plan that would attract  people of color and other marginalized groups within the queer and disabled communities in the  local Bay Area. We also could not under- stand the overarching mentality of many of the  attendees, perhaps best expressed by a remark made in a breakout session: “Being disabled is just  like being black, so society should stop hating us and give us our rights.” : ",queer,disabled,people of color,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Society for Disability Studies Annual Conference, 2005 : During the business meeting at the conference’s conclusion, the people of color caucus presented  a list of action items to the membership in an effort to shore up the marginal presence race and  ethnicity had at the conference (despite the fact that the conference was themed “Conversations  and Connections Across Race and Disability”). Although the hour-long conversation that ensued  was collegial and productive, I cannot help wondering, drawing on my experience at the Queer  Disability Conference, how many times these questions of inclusion and exclusion have to be  raised by people of color to white individuals? As I averred during the business meeting, “I’m  tired of being one of the few to point out what should be obvious.” : ",people of color,race,disability,queer,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : and the University  Convened on the campus of Emory University March 5–7, 2004, the conference is notable at the  outset for the sheer whiteness of those who presented. A quick glance down the list of presenters  (as published in PMLA in 2005)4 bears this out. An additional concern is the content of what  was shared during this conference. : ",whiteness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : In his address, “Disability: The Next Wave or Twilight of the Gods?,” Lennard Davis,  thankfully, speaks to the white nature of Disability Studies: “Disability studies has by and large  been carried out by white people” (530). He is grossly incorrect, however, in the follow-up  assertion that the field will benefit from “the disability studies book about the African American  experience of disability” (ibid). To be sure, there is no singular, structuralist African American  experience of disability and it is im- prudent to advocate for one. Davis is further incorrect when  he insists that said text must incorporate the recent “post-race” debate. Placing strictures on a text  is foolish, especially when the strictures themselves lack intellectual value and integrity.

" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : In “What Is Disability Studies?,” Simi Linton includes an instructive albeit telling example to il-  lustrate the difficulty of answering the titular question:  A few years ago, a controversy about the golfer Casey Martin and the golf cart captured a  great deal of attention. Martin petitioned the PGA—the Professional Golfers’  Association—for permission to ride a golf cart in pro tournaments as an accommodation  for a mobility impairment. When the PGA turned him down, Martin took the case to court.  It was eventually deliberated in the Supreme Court, where Martin prevailed. The most  significant outcome of the debate, I think, is that the discussion came down to the question,  What is the game of golf? Some people said, If he rides a cart, that’s not golf. I’d like to  know, then, what golf is and who has decided. (519)  As I mentioned, the example is instructive, but also rather telling: GOLF?! Come on! I challenge  the reader to name one non-white golfer . . . Okay, now name one non-white golfer besides Tiger  and Vijay.  ",disability,whiteness,ableism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : On a more serious note, as I read through the collection of essays and presentations from the  Emory conference I am concerned with how often each scholar cites the other, revealing an  uncomfortable incestuousness about Disability Studies. These individuals seem unwilling to step  aside even briefly and let someone else have the (proverbial) microphone for a moment. Granted,  if the MLA calls, there is appeal in the form of professional legitimacy. But I also suggest that  there is appeal in giving someone else a chance to speak to the issues embedded in and examined  by Disability Studies, in asking who will be there and figuring out who should be there, as well  as who has not been asked and why. The failure to do so practically ensures that the silences,  namely those concerning race and ethnicity, will not be addressed and will continue.

" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : If Disability Studies as a field had taken a reflexive look at itself at some point, particularly with  regard to its failings in examining issues of race and ethnicity, there might not be such a glaring  dearth of disability-related scholarship by and about disabled people of color. As it stands,  Disability Studies has a tenuous relationship with race and ethnicity: while the field readily  acknowledges its debt to and inspiration by inquiries such as Black Studies, its efforts at  addressing intersections between dis- ability, race, and ethnicity are, at best, wanting. Disability  Studies claims to examine the experiences of a vast number of disabled people, yet the form that  representation takes is, far too often, a white one. This is by no means a sporadic occurrence.  Quite the contrary, the slights occur habitually and, as the preceding examples prove, in various  contexts, from published works to conferences. I think it is essential to illuminate the fragile  relationship between disability, race, and ethnicity in extant Dis- ability Studies, arguing not so  much for a sea-change in this formulation, rather for a more definitive  and accurate identification of the happening.  ",Disability Studies,race,Black Studies,intersectionality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : What follows then is my ten-point scheme (pace, Mr. Letterman) on how to keep White  Disability Studies in vogue and instantiated as disability praxis. Given the fact that well- intentioned individuals are inclined to ask what can be done to “make things more diverse,” I  have purposely crafted the following as a series of “do nots.” By doing so, I hope to shore up  how presumptuous it is to position the subaltern as the all-knowing savant insofar as issues of  diversity; requesting definitive answers from that person when the answers might best come  from within, following an extended period of rumination.  10.  Do not change a thing.  Let’s keep doing what we’re doing. Let’s remain firmly rooted in  this wave of disability, consciously opting not to move to the next. Let’s continue to  acknowledge white individuals as the Disability Studies core constituency.6 Do not outreach to  communities of color or participate in their events when the opportunity to forge connections  arises. Do not solicit for a themed issue of Disability Studies Quarterly on race, ethnicity and  disability7 and if by chance said issue should be produced, make sure that it occurs only once;  that there are no efforts to ensure that these intersections are spoken to throughout future  iterations of the journal in a non-“special issue” context. In sum, do not change a thing. Continue  to fetishize and exoticize people of color as subalterns by constantly focusing on their race and  ethnicity, but not that of the white subject.  9.  Do not address ethnicity, rather continually focus on race.  Many Disability Studies schol-  ars—and people in general—are unwilling or unable to pick up on the cultural significance of  ethnicity in contraposition to what some are (erroneously) convinced is the biological foundation  of race. Regardless of where the two concepts spring from, the fact is that they are distinct. It  becomes problematic then when all that comprises ethnicity gets collapsed under the umbrella  term of race. As a field White Disability Studies has no stake in this process and therefore should  do nothing to address it.  8.  Do not consider that, as Stuart Hall has explained, “Cultural identity is not an essence  but a positioning”  (229). Generally speaking, the same people who hold power in the commu-  nity of scholars known as Disability Studies are a mimetic rendering of those holding power in  non-disabled communities: white people. Despite the fact that people of color outnumber white  people in the world, white people harbor hegemony and cultural capital. Whether or not  disabled people of color outnumber disabled white individuals—or whether people of color  interested in Disability Studies outnumber whites interested in the same—the fact is Disability  Studies is conceived of as a white field (recall Davis’s comments from the Emory conference).  White Disability Studies should pay no attention to this, doing nothing to change this concep-  tion, this positioning. It does not matter that whiteness is not an essentialist prerequisite for a  disability identity. We can just pretend that it is.  7.  Pay no attention to Ann duCille’s recognition that “[O]ne of the dangers of standing at  an intersection . . . is the likelihood of being run over”  (593). When you come across a non- white disabled person, focus on the disability, eliding the race and ethnicity, letting them be run  over, forgotten. Do not consider how the intersection in which this subject lives influences her  ac- tions and the way she is seen. Choose not to see that intersection and quickly move on down  the road of disability, away from the “perpendicular” roads of race and ethnicity. The fact that  the intersection exists is not your fault. It is a prime example of poor engineering.  6.  Disregard Evelynn Hammonds’s idea that “visibility in and of itself does not erase a  history of silence nor does it challenge the structure of power and domination, symbolic  and mate- rial, that determines what can and cannot be seen”  (141). Do not forgot to revel in  the idea that as more and more disabled people enter the mainstream, all disabled people,  irrespective of their racial and ethnic subjectivity, occupy the same place at the table. Equate  visibility with inclusivity. Sit back and be satisfied, and do not allow yourself to be troubled by  those who carp about their invisibility within disability communities.  5.  Ignore Horkheimer and Adorno’s augury that failure to conform to the culture industry  results in the individual being “left behind”  (37). The two theorists warn of the perils of living  in a culture industry whereby one must subscribe to the right magazines and watch the correct  films in order to be accepted in the culture. White Disability Studies is nothing like this; there is  nothing even remotely similar to a “disability industry.” Thus, it is not true that if you make a  film about “crip culture” and you populate that film with only white people, you will be left  behind. Quite the contrary, you will receive awards and plaudits, kudos and huzzahs, for this. It  is not true that if you enter a room that purports to gather together those interested and engaged  in Disability Studies and see not a single person of color present, those people have been left  behind or otherwise disinvited. Be still; speak not. Do not draw attention to their absence. Let  them be remaindered out. They always have been, and besides, they have probably chosen not to  enter the space.  4.  Make no allowances for liminality and hybridity.  Instead, continue the pretence of  normality, the idea that everything’s just fine and that the disability community is one happy  family with no diversity, no multivalence, only a collective sameness. Do not conceive of the  silences that are imbricated in extant Disability Studies. Likewise, do not conceive of the  concerted efforts to counter those silences, to advocate for liminality and hybridity, as described,  in a different context, in Abena Busia’s “Silencing Sycorax: On African Colonial Discourse and  the Unvoiced Female”:  The systematic refusal to hear our [African American females] speech is not the same  thing as our silence. That we have hitherto been spoken of as absent of silenced does not  mean we have been so . . . The systematic refusal to hear our speech which colonial  literature mirrors, though it has historically removed us from the nexus of certain kinds of  power, does not and never actually could render us silent. In unmasking the  dispossessions of the silences of fiction and the fictions of silence, we (re)construct self- understanding. Furthermore, for women, “Narrative” is not always and only, or even  necessarily a speech act. We women signify: we have many modes of (re)dress. (103–4)  Do not consider how minority discourse from within a minority discourse is in and of itself  counter-hegemonic. Do not encourage the proliferation of that discourse even though it is  resistive and liberating. As we all know, the presence of too many voices results in senseless  cacophony and what good is that?  3.  Do whatever you can not to discuss those texts rife with possibilities insofar as parsing  out intersections between disability, race, and ethnicity, namely: The Souls of Black Folk  In1903,W.E.B.DuBois introduced his concept of double consciousness that speaks to the black  American’s irreconcilable sense of self as “an African” and “an American.” Since there is  nothing to be gained by applying this theory to black disabled subjects (triple consciousness?), it  is best not to consider this text as having any bearing on Disability Studies.  ",White Disability Studies,race,ethnicity,culture,community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : Up From Slavery  Published around the same time as DuBois’s text, Up From Slavery is frequently taught  alongside The Souls of Black Folk. Washington takes a much more assimilationist approach to  black subjectivity in contraposition to DuBois. Perhaps a Disability Studies scholar might draw  parallels between the Washington/DuBois ideas of black subjectivity and the difference between  those disabled subjects who want to advocate for peaceful resistance and mainstreaming in  juxtaposition to those who take a more activist, resistant stance. But then again, that would be an  utter waste of the scholar’s time.  ",disabled,Black,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : Invisible Man  I am an invisible man . . . I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. (3)  The first lines of Ellison’s text speak to the difficulty of black ontology in the United States.  Ellison’s protagonist, of course, is not speaking of a literal invisibility so much as he is drawing  light to how it is that others (read: whites with hegemonic power) choose not to see him in  totality. If this characterization does not seem applicable to Disability Studies—wherein the  racialized subaltern is remembered and considered solely as a matter of convenience more often  than not—I don’t know what would be. Yet it would be foolish to illuminate this text’s  applicability to Disability Studies, or, furthermore, to consider the prophetic final lines of the  novel—“who know but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?” (581)—wherein the  protagonist considers the complexities of representing and/or embodying communal univocality.  I do not recommend examining this.  ",Black,white,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : Beauty: When the Other Dancer Is the Self  This widely-anthologized personal narrative describes Alice Walker’s sense of self as a disabled  subject after she is blinded as a child. “I didn’t pray for sight,” she writes, “I prayed for beauty.”  Any Disability Studies scholar worth her salt should immediately discern the implications of this  statement, but that does not mean that she must act upon it in her scholarship. Likewise, the  scholar might pay attention to Walker’s intentional use of language, e.g., the allusion to Stevie  Wonder towards the end of the narrative. Alas, she might pay attention to it, but there is  absolutely nothing to be gained from explicating it.  ",disabled,language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : The Cure  Ginu Kamani’s short story is set in contemporary India. The protagonist must deal with living in  a culture that has deemed her “too-tall.” What is interesting is that the reader never learns  just how tall she is, evidentiary of a societal code that is unspoken and yet accepted.  Unfortunately, since the story is set in India, where whites are the minority, it cannot be of  interest to a Disability Studies scholar.  “The Adventures of Felix”  Race is usually considered a black and white issue. This film complicates that assessment. The  protagonist, the titular Felix, is a multiracial French gay man with HIV who sets out to find the  father he never knew. Although many critics and individuals familiar with AIDS narratives  herald the film for its portrayal of a person with AIDS who is effortlessly “handling” his disease,  a disability theorist might pay particular attention to how easily AIDS is removed from the  narrative in favor of other concerns. But I doubt that would ever happen.  “Birth of a Nation, or The Clansman”  Long before “Triumph of the Will” was unleashed on the populace, this legendary slice of  propaganda was released and heralded. The issues of performativity at play here are rife for  discussion, as are their implications insofar as who gets to represent race and/or disability. A  Disability Studies scholar might link the use of blackface in this film with the use of non- disabled actors to play disabled figures in contemporary films. But, again, I doubt that would  ever happen.  In sum, continue thinking that these texts are too long (e.g., Invisible Man) and that the disability  perspective is too tangential (e.g., “The Adventures of Felix”) to warrant devoting time to. Do  not select key scenes to analyze and discuss. Ignore the texts altogether. Continue to herald the  overt elisions and missed opportunities.  2.  Do not note how odd “White Disability Studies” looks on this page,  how much effort it  requires (or does it?) to contort one’s tongue in order to articulate it. Do not take into account  how foreign a phrase it seems (although just because something is foreign doesn’t necessarily  mean that it is incomprehensible...).  1.  Do not change a thing.  Keep doing what you’re doing. Do so because what you’re doing is  fine, more than enough to keep White Disability Studies firmly instantiated as the norm. Make  no effort to be more inclusive in your scholarship. Do not start today, do not start tomorrow.  Wait for someone else to do inclusive work. Wait for however long it takes.

" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : By way of conclusion, I want to stress that Disability Studies is not the only field of inquiry  wherein individuals of color are treated as second-class citizens. If anything, Disability Studies is  merely aping the ideology of the vast majority of academic disciplines and ways of thinking that  preceded it and which it now sits alongside of. While I could have devoted this modest proposal  to advocating for a more hybrid Disability Studies, a liminal version, the fact is I am not certain  that advocating for such an idea is a worthwhile undertaking. I deem it far more instructive to  acknowledge that we are positioned in the realm of “White Disability Studies” and continue  along with the truth of this positioning in mind.  ",Disability Studies,White Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Language Association (MLA) Conference on Disability Studies  : Moreover, offering White Disability Studies, even in the form of a tongue-in-cheek modest  proposal, is bound to unnerve many of the individuals who consider themselves engaged in  Disability Studies. White Disability Studies will most likely strike these individuals as a  hyperbolic and counterintuitive claim. Perhaps my actions might be deemed impolitic and  offensive. That is the point. I think it is tactless to dismiss a message solely because of its  ostensible unpopularity or because the individual bearing the message seems undesirable. Such a  process is itself counterintuitive, intended to draw attention away from a message that, while  perhaps unpopular, might contain more than a modicum of validity. Because Disability Studies  in its current incarnation is White Disability Studies, proposing we honor that creates no crisis of  conscience for me. If anything, I take heart in remembering what Bubba Gump declared to  Dorian Gray on “Check, Please!”: “If it looks like a shrimp, and it smells and tastes like a  shrimp, it’s a shrimp.”  ",White Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
