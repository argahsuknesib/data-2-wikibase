" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : A Black Feminist Disability Framework  A Black feminist disability framework has the potential to offer new theoretical paradigms that  lead to a more complex and nuanced understanding of our lives. This framework highlights how  and why Disability Studies must adopt a comprehensively intersectional approach to disability and  non-normative bodies and minds and explains why Black Studies should do the same. With such  a model, scholars might reconceptualize what conditions make for a “good” life, particularly as it  relates to how we work and how we use language. Drawing on historical and theoretical examples  from the fields of Black Studies and Disability Studies, we argue for an enhanced and committed  critical engagement with Black feminist theory, particularly at the intersections or race, gender,  and disability. To facilitate the intersectional analysis we call for, our literature review  cum  discussion is divided into two sections that, first, examines the omission of disability in Black  Studies and race within Disability Studies, and second, discusses Black feminist theory as a useful  intervention that leads to a framework for use in these disciplines and beyond.  : ",Black feminist disability framework,disability studies,Black studies,intersectionality,methodology,Black feminist theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : A Black feminist disability framework centers race, gender, and disability, challenging these  generally siloed theories to work together to better understand the realities for those multiply  marginalized within society. Adopting a Black feminist disability framework gives us the  scaffolding to think in generative ways about the intersectional nature of oppression, thus  reinvigorating our theorizing so as to address the multiplicity of our lives. In the section titled  Disability in Black Studies and Blackness in Disability Studies, we examine how Black Studies  should more explicitly engage disability theory and how Disability Studies can benefit from  interventions from Black Studies. Our section Black Feminist Disability Framework in Practice is  devoted to the application of a Black feminist disability frame- work towards more careful analysis  of the language we use and the ways we work. We conclude by offering readers new sites of study  that a Black feminist disability framework is uniquely poised to address.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : BLACK FEMINIST METHODOLOGY Black Studies has been notoriously slow to incorporate gender into its central analytic framework;  similarly, the neglect of gender in Disability Studies elicited Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s  intervention, and the creation of Feminist Disability Studies (Garland-Thomson 2002). Feminist  Disability Studies has been an important touchstone in our thinking about the implications of race,  class, gender, and sexuality— arenas that Black feminist intersectional theorizing brings to the  fore. Like the Combahee River Collective and the authors of  all the Women are White, all the  Blacks are Men, but Some of Us are Brave , Black feminist scholars have been working within  intersectional frameworks for generations, a practice that evolved even before Kimberlé Crenshaw  coined the term (Combahee River Collective 1982; hull, Scott, and Smith 1993; Crenshaw 1991).  As Black feminist Audre Lorde astutely put it, “There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle  because we do not live single-issue lives” (1984, 138). By pushing for a Black feminist disability  framework, we work to transform these disciplines such that they see the integration of questions  of race, gender, disability, and other vectors of power as essential for their deployment.   ",Black studies,gender,feminist disability studies,intersectionality,single-issue,Black feminist disability framework,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Only a year separates the publication of Kimberlé Crenshaw’s (1991) article “Mapping the  Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence Against Women of Color,” and the  signing of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1990). Both Crenshaw’s articulation of  intersectionality and the signing of ADA serve as pivotal interventions that illuminate the  oppressive structures that impact women of color and disabled people, respectively. Crenshaw  noted the interplay between race and gender in violence against Black women; we take up  intersectionality to argue that a single-issue approach to disability fosters the same pitfalls. Our  intervention requires intersectionality to explicitly attend to disability. It is our contention that  racism, sexism, and ableism share a eugenic impulse that needs to be uncovered and felled.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : By using historical and theoretical examples from Black Studies and Disability Studies, we show  that a Black feminist disability framework is emergent and intersectional. These examples, when  analyzed with such a framework in mind, are rich with unexplored connections across both  disciplines. Embedded within the narratives of some of the central figures and theories of these  fields are the ingredients for creating the unifying framework. For example, the excess strength  and otherwise “too much- ness” of Blackness is an oft-deconstructed trope in Black Studies. The  myth of the  strong Black woman  has been critiqued in many ways, notably by a powerful range of  Black feminist scholars but has rarely been examined as a form of ableism—internalized or social  (Beauboeuf-Lafontant 2009; Cole and Guy-Sheftall 2009; Collins 2000, 2005; Giddings 2007;  Harris-Perry 2011; Mataka 2000). The myth suggests that Black women are uniquely strong, able  to endure pain, and surmount otherwise difficult obstacles because of their innate tenacity. Black  women are disallowed disability and their survival is depoliticized. Survival is a form of resistance  and a source of celebration, particularly in the face of the reality that, as Lucille Clifton said,  “Every day something has tried to kill me and has failed” (Clifton 1993, 25). There is a productive  tension in recognizing the critical connections of the celebration of survival in the context of the  demands made on Black bodies to transcend all suffering (Derricotte 2010). Resilience is praised  while trauma, violence, and pain are too com- mon to actually be interrogated for very long. The  logic of Black hyper- visibility produces subjects that are barred from weakness—and disability  in Western thought as figured through non-normative bodies is the ultimate sign of unsuitability.   ",Black feminist disability framework,intersectional,myth of the strong Black woman,resistance,ableism,resilience,trauma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : To counteract such notions of unsuitability, a form of strategic essentialism has been adopted that  upholds internalized ableism and ultimately disallows Black suffering through embracing an  identification with this presumed hyper-ability. how many of us grew up with parents who warned  us of having to be twice as good as our white counterparts? Designed to fortify Black children  against the profound racism that is masked in a masquerade of meritocracy, this notion of having  to be “twice as good,” while often true, also marks the difficulties with dis- cussing trauma, health  disparities, and psychiatric or physical disabilities within Black communities. If one is not able to  work twice as hard to keep up with the masquerade, then what value does one have to the project  of Black redemption? The cultural tradition from which this adage stems has been supported by  studies and corroborated with empirical evidence. Black people are more likely to be surveilled,  punished, and passed over for promotion than their white counterparts in all societal institutions.  Black workers must demonstrate a significantly higher level of skill than their white counterparts  in order to keep their jobs despite receiving lower wages and fewer opportunities for promotion  (White 2015). Black people cannot afford to be disabled when they are required to be  phantasmically abled in a white supremacist society. By bringing disability studies and a Black  feminist theoretical lens to address this myth, scholars are better able to explain Black people’s  reluctance to identify as disabled and potentially offer new strategies for dismantling ableism  within Black Studies.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Black feminist texts can provide a methodological map for the integration of disability, race, and  gender, even when disability is not named as such. In  incidents in the life of a Slave Girl , Harriet  Jacobs ([1861] 1987) detailed how her confinement in an attic room as she attempted to steal  herself away from slavery caused her pain and impaired her body long after she gained her  freedom. She implied that she traded her abled body for bodily freedom, a tactic utilized and  observed in other accounts from the enslaved. Over a hundred years later, Audre Lorde did not  frame her battle with cancer or the fact that she was legally blind in identarian terms, though her  work in the  Cancer Journals  and other essays is profoundly shaped by her experiences with both.  In discussing her desire to write the  Cancer Journals , Lorde lamented that she had no writing to  turn to that described the experiences of a Black lesbian woman surviving cancer. These are but  two examples of Black feminism engaging race and disability in all but name, prior to the  development of both Black Studies and Disability Studies as scholarly fields.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Our primary methods of analysis for this article involved reviewing and mining concepts and  narratives from Black Studies and Disability Studies, such as the trope of the strong Black woman  or Lorde’s  Cancer Journals , for the ways in which disability and race go underexamined.  Throughout each section, we use Black feminism’s clarion call for intersectional analysis to stitch  the fields together. By using a Black feminists disability framework, a paradigm shift in Black  Studies and Disability Studies becomes possible.   DISABILITY IN BLACK STUDIES AND BLACKNESS IN DISABILITY STUDIES All the Blacks Are Able-Bodied  Scholars of Blackness have continually noted the powerful repercussions of stigmatized  embodiment on the everyday lives and material realities of Black people. At the same time, Black  Studies scholars have approached embodiment with varying levels of attention to gender. Ida B.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Wells eloquently elucidated the connection between white fear, false accusations, and state- sanctioned violence in lynching cases of mostly Black men (Wells- Barnett 1996). W.E.B.  Dubois’s oft quoted and canonical assertion of “double consciousness” itself suggests the complex  psychological defenses that Black people have developed in response to being targets of bodily  and mental violence (Du Bois 1909). More contemporarily, we might consider Melissa Harris  Perry’s framing of “the crooked room,” which dictates the inherently racist and sexist standards  by which many Black women are not only judged but also encouraged to orient a sense of value  and self around (2011, 1). henry Louis Gates (1989) wrote about the role of physical dominance— and by extension disability—in African American literature, from Frederick Douglass’s  recounting of Aunt Hester’s brutal beating, to Harriet Tubman’s negotiation of her epileptic  seizures. In all of these instances, the body and disability are hailed, if not explicitly named.   ",state violence,gender,race,sexism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Yet, it is perhaps precisely because of Black Studies’ deep familiarity with stigmatized  embodiment that scholars in these fields have not more substantively taken up disability as core to  their work, or more comprehensively engaged Disability Studies. In addition, Disability Studies is  a field that we acknowledge is fraught with omissions, as it often ignores race as an analytic  category. But whether it is lynching cases, Aunt Hester’s beating, or Tubman’s navigation of her  seizures, Black Studies often prioritizes race over disability (and gender) as interlocutors pertinent  to the analysis.    Blackness has not only been stigmatized but has also been used to elect candidates for death and  destruction. As Nirmala Erevelles (2014) notes in  Crippin’ Jim Crow , race and disability have  been used in tandem to incarcerate Black people for decades. The additional perceived stigma of  disability is an added threat to an always already perilous identity group (Goffman 2009; Link and  Phelan 2001; Scambler 2004). Race—and specifically Blackness—has been used to mark  disability, while disability has inherently “Blackened” those perceived as unfit. Black people  were—and continue to be—assumed intellectually disabled precisely because of race.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Black bodies were assumed to be suited only for work, and not for freedom. From Thomas  Jefferson’s assertion that Blackness inherently barred one from full cognitive citizenship, to the  blossoming of eugenics in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that linked race and ability  through scientifically racist theories that denigrated Black intelligence, Blackness has been  consistently linked with lack and subhuman status. In her exhaustively researched work,  Neither  Fugitive, Nor Free: Atlantic Slavery, Freedom Suits, and the legal Culture of travel , Edlie L. Wong  (2009) points out that in the U.S. courtroom, Black people were framed through “Black legal  disabilities,” that barred people of African descent from full citizenship. Race marks Black people  as being inherently disabled, fundamentally other. In this way, race and disability are mutually  constitutive.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : In a western frame, Blackness is the antithesis of whiteness, the necessary other that creates the  dichotomized racial caste system. Similarly, disabled and able-bodied function as two oppositional  poles that belie the slippages and realities in between. Black people are afforded the curious task  of being simultaneously hyper-able-bodied and disabled, while at the same time being locked into  ideologies that figure us as both superhumanly strong and pathologically inept. This paradox  persists, locking Black men into narratives of superhuman athletic ability and lowered academic  expectations, and embroiling Black women into stereotypes of indefatigability and sexual  delinquency (Axelsen 1985; Davis 2003). Black boys find themselves disproportionately shuttered  in special education classrooms while simultaneously encouraged to excel at physically demanding  activities like sports. Conversely, Black girls are often reprimanded for not comporting themselves  like their white girl classmates, becoming frequent recipients of in-school suspensions and other  disciplinary punishments for failing to meet standards of white femininity (Ladson Billings 2011).  Black girl bodies are surveilled and judged “too developed,” making them responsible for any  sexual violence they experience (Bailey 2016). These modern effects of centuries- old stereotypes  demand the more political scholarship that Black feminism provides.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : By the mid-nineteenth century, under the regime of American chattel slavery, Black people’s  desire for freedom was pathologized through a plethora of laws, practices, and social stipulations— all of which were designed to frame Blackness as inherently inferior. In fact, as part of the  propaganda supporting American chattel slavery, the notion that Black people were naturally  intended to be slaves became a mainstay of the pro- slavery argument. Part of that pro-slavery  dogma introduced the idea of drapetomania—making the Black desire for freedom a  psychologically aberrant mental illness. In  Medical apartheid , Harriet Washington (2006) outlined  the various ways in which Black desires for freedom were cur- tailed—either through medical  diagnosis (in the case of drapetomania) or via physical domination—intentionally disabling  enslaved people (through amputation, physical marking, or limb restriction) to prevent escape,  assert dominance, and exert bodily control (36). The specter of disability permeates the Black  scholarship of enslavement and other studies of the Black experience.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Much of the Black experience is shaped by an understanding of Black bodies as a productive labor  force, leaving little room for an identity- based approach to disability. Figurations of Blackness as  hyper able and yet fundamentally “crippled” by race have been used to produce Black people as  ineligible or unsound for citizenship. historically, Black people have been valued for their utility,  particularly in a former slave economy. For this reason, the stakes for identifying as disabled, or  acknowledging a compromised relationship to labor and the ability to generate capital, is often not  a viable option for most Black people. Stigma further complicates acknowledging disability, as it  places an already precarious self at further risk of marginalization and vulnerability to state and  medical violence, incarceration, and economic exploitation.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Ableism and notions of disability are a major component of anti-Black racism. Stereotypes about  Black women’s hypersexual natures were used to justify sexual violence against Black women  (Collins 2005). The idea that Black people are not as smart as white people, and beliefs that Black  people are closer to animals, all incorporate ableist and white supremacist ideas about Black bodies  that help rationalize Black social subservience. Black club women and activists in the early  twentieth century often con- fronted stereotypes that marshalled raced, gendered, and ableist  concepts of Black people and Black women specifically. Their utilization of respectability politics  to refute these stereotypes were an attempt to reframe Black representation in society  (Higginbotham 1992). This impulse to maintain and mimic the power structures’ ideas about  appropriate white societal behavior lingers even today in Black Studies liberatory imaginations  and in popular culture as well.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : One of the longstanding critiques of Black Studies is the deeply embedded patriarchy of the field  and its ideas about liberation (Christian 1989). A vision of Black men no longer emasculated and  heads of the household with wives and obedient children dominates many of these liberatory  fantasies. Even cosmologies that attempt to embrace a less Eurocentric model of success and  partnering still often evoke a patriarchal familial dynamic where women are subordinate. What of  disabled Black men who cannot work? Are they failed men because they do not meet the able- bodied expectations of liberation? Are they less masculine if they are queer or are they queered by  not having a valorized form of masculinity? Care is feminized and thus devalued in our culture,  and this ideology is still embedded in some liberatory futures that are imagined in Black Studies.   ",patriarchy,Black,disabled,liberation,Black masculinity,nondisabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : A Black feminist disability framework helps shift this paradigm. Able-bodiedness and having a  job are masculinized; even as Black Studies critiques whiteness it still reinforces ideas about being  a respect- able Black person with an able-bodied heterosexual nuclear family. The critical artistic  work that Leroy Moore is doing to challenge our ideas around Black masculinity should be more  fully embraced by both Disability Studies and Black Studies (Moore 2017). We must recalibrate  our expectations such that Black people are valuable beyond their ability to be productive to the  State.   ,Black feminist disability framework,nondisabled,Black masculinity,whiteness,productivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : When we discuss the vital importance of Black lives mattering in this contemporary moment, as  Disability Studies scholar Akemi Nishida asks, do we also mean the lives of Black disabled people  (Dunhamn et al. 2015)? Can we be as fervent in our desire for justice for Mario Woods, Jeremy  McDole, or Kevin Mathews as we are for Tamir Rice or Michael Brown (Matier and Ross 2016;  Delawareonline  2016; Good 2016)? Do we imagine that those who live with disabilities live less  valuable lives— and if so, how does that seep into our work? Are we prepared to reach toward a  radical liberatory corporeal politics that imagines and makes space for truly free Black bodies of  all abilities?   When All the Disabled Are White  As the 1960s and 1970s mobilized marginalized groups around the structural nature of their  oppressions, so too were disabled people beginning to think through their experiences in society  as connected to a stigmatized social identity. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 would serve as a model  for the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Garland-Thomson and Bailey 2010). Similarly,  the formation of Black Studies and Women’s Studies departments sowed the seeds for Disability  Studies to be recognized as a field in its own right.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : When we analyze the discourse of the popularized history of disability rights, we see white men  with class privilege upset about the ways they have been excluded from mainstream society and  their birth right. The work of disabled people of color in the movement is often obscured (Schweik  2011). Part of the activism of white, privileged men is premised on not being able to access the  full power of their whiteness and masculinity. The 2005 documentary  Murderball  addressed this  point by profiling mostly white men who play wheelchair rugby, otherwise known as “murderball”  due to the violent nature of the sport (Rubin and Shapiro 2005). The white men participants talked  about how the sport gave them access to a masculinity they were often denied because they were  not able-bodied. But one wonders what the perception would have been of predominantly Black  men playing a game called “murderball”? The racial implications of white masculinity go  uninterrogated both in the film and also in scholarship about the film.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Race never leaves us in this country; it is an ever-present ghoul—a spectral, demonic force. We  invoke the notion of ghouls to drive home the destructive, haunting, and powerful nature of white  supremacy. From colonization to enslavement to lynching, racism as an ideology has served as an  all-encompassing embodiment on which U.S. society is built. Disability, like race, is with us  always. The tropes utilized to distinguish between supposedly superior white bodies and  purportedly inferior bodies of color have relied on corporeal assessments that take the able white  male body as the center and “norm.” Notions of disability inform how theories of race were  formed, and theories of racial embodiment and inferiority (racism) formed the ways in which we  conceptualize disability.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : A Black feminist disability framework dislodges the white male body as the central normative  body in Disability Studies, establishing the need to examine how bodies are raced and the ways in  which this intersects with disability, disease, and bodily sovereignty. By moving racially and  gender marginalized people to the center of Disability Studies, new considerations of existing  theoretical perspectives are required. Close dis- cursive readings of Disability Studies theories  reveal an important need for conversations that are grounded in race, gender, and class  simultaneously.   ",Black feminist disability framework,Disability studies,race,gender,class,disability ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : A significant feature of Disability Studies theorizing is the articulation of the social and medical  models of disability. The medical model of dis- ability treats impairment as an individual issue  that must be medically addressed. Something has gone  wrong  when impairment occurs, and there  needs to be individualized medical care to restore the person to proper  health  through corrective  surgeries, prostheses, and other forms of intervention. The social model, however, suggests that it  is actually the way our society is set up that creates disability and inaccessibility. For example, the  use of stairs in architecture to access buildings is a social choice and could be easily replaced with  ramps were it not for the social pressure to maintain systems that benefit able bodies. To paraphrase  an example from attorney and disability activist Stella Young, no amount of staring at a flight of  steps made those steps wheelchair accessible (“Practicing Pride in the Face of Exclusion” 2014).  Similarly, scholars of race have focused on the ways in which society treats and refuses to grant  access to marginalized people of color. Disability, like our ideas about race and gender, are socially  constructed. however, the fact that race, gender, and disability are socially constructed does not  mean they are not real.   ",social model,medical model,Disability Studies,race,disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : While the critique of the medical model of disability is not only war- ranted but critical, it is also  important to remember that, for some, talking about having access to the healing therapies offered  by the medical field is part of addressing the medical field’s long disinvestment in Black health.  Disability Studies’ critiques of the medical field manage to understate or entirely ignore the  historically exploitative relationship between Black communities and the medical field. Disability  Studies has consistently produced a critique of the medical model of disability that obfuscates the  particular vulnerability of Black, women, and gender-nonconforming bodies. While certainly the  medical model is a problematic trope, it may signal differently to communities that have tried for  many decades to receive the most elementary care only to be refused. As uncomfortable as it may  make those of us engaged in the Disability Studies field, some communities are actually yearning  for not only care but treatment and cure. Part of corporeal autonomy as a theoretical stance—one  that links both Blackness and disability—is that it allows for people to choose what is best for their  bodies: treatment, cure, or a resistance to medical intervention altogether.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Lastly, the medical model may be one of the few places where the traumatic injury and stress of  quotidian racism is quantitatively catalogued: an intellectual location where we witness how the  grinding injustices of racism, sexism, misogynoir, homophobia, transphobia, classism—and yes,  ableism—impact Black lives (Bailey 2016). Black people have a vexed, tenuous, and painful  relationship with medicine. Disability studies should consider how to pose nuanced, sophisticated  and culturally responsive frameworks within which to consider the racialized poetics of the  medical model of disability.   ",medical model,racism,ableism,Disability Studies,Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Disability justice scholars and activists—largely queer and trans people of color—have pushed  back on the understandings of the social model of disability as well (Berne 2015; Mingus 2011).  They, too, question social structure but point out the internalized ableism of expecting everyone  to participate in society in the same way (Watts and Erevelles 2004). As opposed to demanding  disabled representation and access to mainstream arenas of power, they take the approach of also  valuing crip spaces. They question the speed at which we expect our world to function. These  activists and scholars recognize that equity for queer, trans, and Black people also has been  overwhelmingly about access to adequate medical care. These activists demand adherence to a  social model of disability that requires a complex and nuanced engagement with the medical needs  and realities of some populations.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Though Disability Studies has disposed of the social model because it simplifies a complex  relationship between people’s impairments and dis- abilities, it is nonetheless useful for our  purposes as we interrogate Black people’s reluctance to identify as disabled. The language of  “impairment” and “disability” helps us distinguish between dominant identifications, as opposed  to facets of bodily realities that impact how Black people may be understanding their experiences  of bodily difference.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Disability Studies shares a strong critique of eugenic medicine with Black Studies. A range of  scholars have recently addressed (and problematized) the difficult relationship between medicine  and race, and the social versus medical model of disability. In her piece, “My Most humiliating  Jim Crow Experience: Afro-Modernist Critiques of Eugenics and Medical Segregation,” Jess  Waggoner (2016) confronts the impact of racial segregation on medical treatment that gives rise  to medical justice. The recent work of Leroy Moore (2017), The Harriet Tubman Collective  (2016), Owens, Cooper, and Buttes (2008), and Rana A. Hogarth (2017) all call for close  examinations of how Blackness is taken up and exploited by the field of medicine. The work of  Harriet Washington (2006) and Dorothy Roberts (1997) addresses the misogynoiristic eugenic  legacies of our medical systems without being fully understood or addressed as Disability Studies  scholarship. The late Chris Bell, himself formerly a president of the Society of Disability Studies,  did much in his own work to forge the connections between Black Studies and Disability Studies.  his groundbreaking collection,  Blackness and Disability  (Bell 2011), brought together Black  scholars explicitly doing work at these intersections. While many disability scholars pay homage  to Bell, their citations of his work have not led to the fundamental shift that he desired Disability  Studies to make. Recent scholarship has initiated exciting conversations and assemblages between  Disability Studies and Black Studies. Sami Schalk’s book  Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability,  Race, and Gender in Black Women’s Speculative Fiction  (2018) drives home the connection  between race, gender, and disability. Schalk’s scholarship is joined by the work of a cadre of  emerging scholars who ground their work in Black feminist methodologies, including Angel Miles  and Michelle Jarman (Miles, Nishida, and Forber-Pratt 2017). Therí A. Pickens was the editor of  a special issue of the  African American Review  (2017), the first entire issue focused on disability  and only the second time that a scholar has endeavored to bring together a broad array of those  working at the inter- section of Black Studies and disability.   BLACK FEMINIST DISABILITY FRAMEWORK IN PRACTICE  Issues of rhetoric and language as they relate to Black vernacular and disability are another site of  interrogation for a Black feminist disability framework. Black people are often singled out and  critiqued for the use of ableist language. A national firestorm erupted when the musical group  Black Eyed Peas released a song initially titled, “Let’s Get Retarded.” The ableist anthem was  quickly swatted down and the lyrics and title were changed to, “Let’s Get It Started” (Bailey 2011).  This swift correction was a missed opportunity to discuss why the word shouldn’t be used, beyond  the hurt it causes certain communities. What often is missing from con- versations that attempt to  address problematic language are the origins and impact of those words in creating and  maintaining a climate of ableism. It is not enough to get people to stop saying certain words if the  underlying ableism remains unchallenged.   ",medical racism,misogynoir,Black Studies,Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Furthermore, like the “n-word,” Black cultural production is often rear- ranging the original  meaning and use of words for specific anti-racist purposes. Black feminists discuss the nuances of  “bitch” as a multivalent word that can signal misogynoir or familiarity, depending on context and  speaker. Nowhere is this conversation more fraught than with the use of the word “crazy.”  Disability scholars and advocates have lamented the ubiquity of the term in modern speech,  identifying crazy as a term that further stigmatizes people with psychiatric disabilities. Across  cultures and generations, people use the word to mean many things, the least of which is a person  with an actual psychiatric disability. For many Black people, the phrase “white people are crazy”  is a common exclamation that expresses the incredulity of racist and other seemingly  unexplainable behavior by white people. Given the violent unprovoked racism that whites enact  towards Blacks, the adage seems not far from true. The unreasonableness of racism further  complicates the murkiness of whether crazy is an apt description for white racist behavior. And  what of the mental anguish of racism? In Toni Morrison’s  Beloved  (1987), Sethe, the protagonist,  is forced to make an impossible choice because of the racist violence she has endured. This act  haunts her life, eventually making her go “crazy.” Is there a way to reclaim crazy, or at least  acknowledge the ways that anti-Black racism is  crazy-making  for both white and Black people  alike? Madness studies—and Black scholars within that field like La Marr Bruce (2012, 2017)— ask us to consider the implications of Black madness in racist systems.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Crazy has also been weaponized against Black women in ways that Black feminists are beginning  to unpack. In a March 30, 2015, webinar about state violence against Black women and girls,  speaker Barbara Arnwine talked about the police killings of Tanisha Anderson and Michelle  Cusseaux, both Black women in the midst of mental health episodes that were used to justify their  deaths. Arnwine aligned the “crazy Black woman” trope with the “rebellious black b[itch]” myth  from slavery, showing the slippery nature of racism and its continued impact on our lives  (#herDreamDeferred 2015). The conversation did not, however, illuminate the ways that Black  people with psychiatric or physical disabilities are disproportionately harmed by police violence  (Perry 2017).

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : With a Black feminist disability framework, we can think critically about the way that crazy is  deployed for mass murderers, and their white- ness and maleness often goes unacknowledged. We  can begin to actualize theoretical interventions that challenge mainstream news narratives that  erase race and gender and forestall the ableism used to explain away white violence. It is through  praxis that we can start to create a new scholarship that is informed not just by our critical inquiries  but also by our resulting actions and processes that shift previous paradigms of understanding.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Disability rights activists frequently cite that disabled people are the largest minority group in the  united States. This statistic is used to substantiate calls for disabled unity and collective action.  however, this statement misses the very nuances within the largest minority that prevent the types  of collective action that is envisioned. how does one compare the drunk-driving-induced paralyses  of a white high school quarterback to the job-acquired carpal tunnel of immigrant women assembly  line workers? Or the intentional lead poisoning of the Black children in Flint, Michigan, with  congenital disabilities that are the result of chance? The age of onset of these disabilities, the  manner in which they were acquired, along with gender, class, and race all shape the way that  people are treated, interpellated, have access to resources, or move through society.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : In their study, Amani M. Nuru-Jeter, Roland h. Thorpe Jr., and Esme Fuller-Thomson (2011) noted  that “Black people experienced higher odds of disability across the adult lifespan compared with  white people” (834). Their study examined disability across the life span of Black people and  found stark disparities between white and Black people regarding disability. They noted that  despite the higher prevalence of disability within Black and other communities of color, the  disability rights movement and Disability Studies remain white in leadership and in stated  objectives and outcomes.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : The racial and gender disparities do not end there. Women provide most of the care for disabled  people globally. More specifically, women of color disproportionately care for disabled people  (Family Caregiver Alliance 2016). Black Studies and Disability Studies need to consider that  Black women and other women of color do most of the labor in the ser- vice of disability despite  the impact on their ability to care for themselves or their families. Caregivers are often engaged in  debilitating work for disabled people and become disabled themselves (Moore 2015). The Family  Caregiver Alliance notes that 40 to 70 percent of caregivers have symptoms of clinical depression,  and caregivers also report worsening physical health as a result of the demands of caregiving on  the body (Family Caregiver Alliance 2016). A Black feminist disability framework would ensure  that race, age of onset, method of acquirement, gender, sexuality, and other important aspects of  the way disability is multiply inflected are brought to bear in our analysis.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : According to a 2014 U.S. Department of Labor study, Black people are more likely to be disabled  than whites, Latinxs, and Asian Americans. Black people have worked and continue to work  debilitating jobs (U.S. Department of Labor 2015). The United States Social Security  Administration (SSA) found that “Black workers in every age group shown are more likely to die  or become eligible for Social Security disability benefits” (2000, 1). Moreover, because social  security benefits are often based on previous wage labor, Black people—and Black women  specifically—drawing social security are drawing from a lower overall rate of pay than their white  predecessors, thus impacting how much sup- port they are eligible for from the SSA (Parekh 2008).  In an article for  Business insider , author Laura Friedman reported that while the average life  expectancy in the United States is 79 years there is at least a four-year gap between the life  expectancy for Black and white Americans (2014). The median age of death for Black men in the  District of Columbia is 66 years. The Centers for Disease Control—steeped in the medical  model— lists 15 major categories under which Black men succumb, including work conditions,  heart disease, diabetes, police violence, homicide, and perinatal conditions that are more likely to  go untreated. White men with at least 16 years of education live a full 14 years longer than Black  men— on average (CDC 2015).

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Despite the reluctance of some Black scholars to engage Disability Studies, Black Studies research  has much to teach the field of Disability Studies. Black people, particularly Black women, are  more likely to care for disabled relatives and keep them connected to their communities. Black  and other people of color have higher rates of disability than their white counterparts. Black Studies  research suggests that Black people are employing a different model, one of collectivity and  potential interdependence that eschews the individualist model of a disability rights frame- work.  Black Studies and Disability Studies scholars could call for strategies that not only facilitate the  independence of disabled people to do what able-bodied people do and go where able-bodied  people go, but also critique the assumption that independence is inherently valuable given the  demographics of caregivers and those cared for. Black feminism becomes an essential interlocutor  for these questions.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Disability Studies questions how jobs are structured, the impossibility of a five-day work week for  everyone, and the demand that everyone work. Not only are some jobs debilitating, some people  are unable to work. how might we reimagine our labor organizing if we do not assume that  everyone should work to get their needs met? how might we restructure society itself if we could  meet our needs without working jobs, how- ever dignified and humane they might become?   A Black feminist disability framework reconceptualizes our ideas about work and labor. While  Black Studies has successfully critiqued U.S. labor practices, it has not gone so far as to critique  work  itself. “Jobs with dignity” still assumes that people are able to work a job and that the  structure of the 9-to-5 workday makes sense. The racist discrimination against people with Black  sounding names is now well documented, and while we need strategies to address prejudicial  hiring practices we must also question the conditions under which we are expected to work. All  too often people ask what is a respectable job, rather than offering a critique of a service economy  or the globalizing socioeconomic system that demands more and more labor for less and less pay.  A critique of wages has yet to fully take on the fact that Black women make less than Black men  and white women, in addition to performing the second shift at home (Patten 2016). A Black  feminist disability framework demands a recalibration of labor expectations for those who are also  primary caretakers.   CONCLUSION  We want scholarship that can inform better direct services and actions for those living daily with  and through social death (Sexton 2011). When the material body is centered, how do our  theoretical arguments and subsequent activism and organizing need to change? We can begin to  delve more deeply into the theories of state violence and bodily control and sovereignty that  scholars like Harriet Jacobs point us toward in her writing (Stewart 2015). The theoretical  interventions of Afro- pessimism and Black nihilism have much to say about Black death but do  not connect these conversations overtly to disability. The incorporation of disability into these  theoretical projects might help us think through the ways in which we imagine a Black life that is  more than just survival and more than able-bodied utopia. What does liberation look like if disabled  Black bodies are allowed in our futures? Would we be better able to hold Disability Studies  accountable for its erasure of raced and gendered bodies?   Additionally, we might reclaim critically important Black figures in history who were otherwise  erased from the archive because of their race, disability, or because they inhabit the intersection of  both race and disability. This is not a project of posthumously assigning people a label that they  wouldn’t have chosen for themselves but looking critically at the context of a life and thinking  through disability as an equally powerful force in shaping a person. By reassessing our heroes of  the past with the lens of disability, we can provide more texture and more humanity to our portrayal  of our ancestors. Whether it is the painful epileptic seizures of Harriet Tubman that helped her stay  ahead of bounty hunters or the Mississippi appendectomy that spurred Fannie Lou Hamer’s  activism, the intersections of disability and race in the bodily praxis of historical Black figures  needs to be more deeply addressed.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : Disabled Black women experience “intersecting patterns of racism and sexism. . . . Because of  their intersectional identity as both women and of color within discourses that are shaped to  respond to one or the other, women of color are marginalized within both” (Crenshaw 1991). As  we have shown, Disability Studies often neglects racism and sexism’s impact on disability, just as  Black Studies can omit the realities of ableism and sexism’s impact on race. Rather than  reformulate Crenshaw’s model, we build on the intersectional work of scholars in both fields to  suggest that disability, race, and gender are always already present and simply need to be attended  to in our analysis.

" WORK IN THE INTERSECTIONS:  : To have a conversation and far more generative theoretical projects that ultimately serve the goal  of our collective liberation, this article moves unnecessarily disparate theoretical spaces toward  each other, in order. If Black Studies took up disability and gender more comprehensively and  productively confronted ableism, we might discard ableist language and create new language. Too  often we use metaphors that subtly undermine our liberatory agendas, but we also have the power  to transform ableist invective in equally liberatory ways. If Disability Studies took up Black  Studies and critical race theory in ways that displaced the white disabled body as the norm, we  might gain a stronger, more flexible, and globally relevant framework from which to critique late  neoliberal capitalism. Too often we engage race and its impact as an additive or comparative cate-  gory of difference rather than a constitutive aspect of notions of disability in the West. When  disability is more seriously regarded within Black Studies, race within Disability Studies, and  gender in both, there are an infinite number of revolutions that a Black feminist disability  framework can help bring about.
