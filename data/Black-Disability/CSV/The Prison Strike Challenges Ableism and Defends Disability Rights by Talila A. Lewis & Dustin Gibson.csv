" The Prison Strike Challenges Ableism : and Defends Disability Rights  This week, as what may be the  largest prison strike in US history  continues to  unfold, disability rights groups have a historic opportunity to act in solidarity  with striking imprisoned people and articulate the deep overlaps in our  communities and in our struggles. :  Some disability justice collectives and organizations have already amplified  this  historic rebellion  to  highlight the ableism, sanism and audism  that are  deeply rooted throughout the entire criminal legal system. However, disability  rights and deaf rights organizations must do far more to effectively practice  disability solidarity with the strike and help people understand  the nexus  between racism, classism, ableism and incarceration .

" The Prison Strike Challenges Ableism : After centuries of disabled people being forced into all manner of institutions  — asylums, nursing homes, poor houses, jails, prisons, etc. — disability  communities are  acutely aware  of how institutions often serve as breeding  grounds for human and civil rights violations with very little, if any, visibility,  accountability, or public scrutiny and outcry. Yet still, there is a palpable lack  of ire from disability rights communities (not to be confused with  disability  justice  communities, which refuse to solely rely upon the legal system for  liberatory purposes) toward carceral-based institutions that steal disabled  people in the name of “justice.”  Disabled people continue to be preeminent targets for state surveillance,  violence and deprivation of rights and freedom. It should come as no surprise  then, that despite comprising just 25 percent of the U.S. population, disabled  people represent about  85 percent of those youth found in kid prisons , and  anywhere between 40-80 percent of the adult prison population — with no  one actually having an accurate accounting of disability in our adult carceral  system. As is true in every kind of institution,  disabled people in our nation’s  prisons are prime targets  for violence, exploitation, isolation and other  injustices.

" The Prison Strike Challenges Ableism : As community builders who live, organize and advocate at the intersection of  disability and numerous other marginalities, on the occasion of this historic  prison strike, we call on disability communities to work in solidarity with  imprisoned people, and we call upon those engaged in decarceration and  abolition work to remember to name and address disability amidst the  ongoing struggle against systems of oppression.   The current prison uprising began on August 21, when thousands of  imprisoned people in at least 17 states initiated a strike in response to  an  uprising at Lee Correctional Institution , South Carolina’s largest maximum  security prison. Over the course of seven hours, prison officials and medical  personnel refused to intervene as violence erupted. August 21 strike organizers  at  Jailhouse Lawyers Speak  lamented this tragic day and condemned the  prison conditions and profiteering that led to the uprising, stating: ",disability,solidarity,prison strike,context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Strike Demands  Most people are unaware of the unremitting disability-based injustices found  within our legal and penal systems. This disability consciousness gap is likely  due to the fact that the majority of society has come to understand disability  through a lens of whiteness, wealth and other privileges that actively excludes  the experiences of nonwhite, low-income people — namely people that have  experienced or witnessed violence; those who come from or reside in  communities that have endured generational trauma; and those who live in  financial precarity. :  Here are the 10 prison strike demands and just some of the ways in which  each demand implicates disability:  1. Immediate improvements to the conditions of prisons and prison  policies that recognize the humanity of imprisoned men and  women.",disability,prison,carceral,whiteness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Disabled people are the largest “minority” population in jails and prisons in  large part because they are  disproportionately represented  in incidents of  police use of force, arrests and convictions. In addition, current conditions of  confinement in jails and prisons create and exacerbate disability, especially  because incarcerated people experience extreme abuse, medical neglect and  isolation in our prisons.   Those who come in without disabilities are likely to experience disabilities  while incarcerated that  often last  long after their release. Incarcerated people  are often malnourished or ill because they are provided unhealthy and  unsanitary food and forced to drink contaminated water or expired drinks. ",disabled people,prison,disproportionately represented,police violence,incarcerated people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : This often leads to imprisoned people resorting to  eating unhealthy , sugar-  and sodium-saturated foods sold at a premium in prison commissaries.   Similar to low-income neighborhoods, prisons are often built on  toxic or  environmentally unsafe land , having outdated water and sewage systems, both  of which lead to various health conditions. Sufficient meals for those with  dietary restrictions are difficult to come by, if and where they are available. ",incarcerated people,neglect,state violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Solitary confinement is used to punish or “protect” imprisoned people,  including disabled people and those who have suicidal ideations (often  activated by conditions of confinement). Solitary confinement beyond two  weeks is considered torture by the United Nations but on any given day, here  in the US we have  80,000-100,000 being held in solitary confinement  — some  for months, years or decades, even. In  some cases , prison officials have  encouraged imprisoned people to commit suicide. Exercise is routinely  prevented, as when held in solitary confinement, and access to fresh air and  natural light is restricted. Overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions lead  to the rapid spread of communicable and infectious diseases.  ",solitary confinement,incarcerated people,disabled people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : On top of all this,  health care contracts  are granted to corporations whose  bottom line is profit, not quality, such that only the bare minimum is  provided. Imprisoned people are therefore often forced to seek counsel and  sue just  to receive life-saving  medical attention. Inhumane prison conditions  are not unlike those conditions survived by disabled people who have been  warehoused in other kinds of institutions, where, for example, psychiatric  institutions would lock “patients”  in cages .   Similarities between prisons and other institutions are not a coincidence.  Victories in the struggle against the violent and unhealthy conditions of jails  and prisons will save disabled people’s lives.  2. An immediate end to prison slavery. All persons imprisoned in  any place of detention under United States jurisdiction must be  paid the prevailing wage in their state or territory for their labor.",incarcerated people,ableism,access to medical treatment,institutions,prison,prison slavery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Capitalism demands that our value as people be determined in part by our  capacity to produce. The goal of capitalism is to maximize profit, which has  always relied on the unpaid labor and exploitation of bodies — specifically,  Black/Indigenous bodies. The ableist structure of the labor system allows  people labeled as disabled to be paid  subminimum wages  or excludes them  from employment opportunities altogether, while simultaneously disabling  others through forced labor in harsh conditions for so little pay that they  cannot care for themselves or their loved ones. These practices continue to  serve as mechanisms of mass exploitation of disabled and negatively racialized  people, shape-shifting over time to trap the most exploitable marginalized  groups of each era — from enslavement, to convict leasing and prison labor, to  migrant labor or sheltered workshops where disabled people are legally paid  nothing or pennies on the hour.   3. The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) must be rescinded,  allowing imprisoned humans a proper channel to address  grievances and violations of their rights. ",productivity,capitalism,ableism,prison slavery,disablement,Prison Litigation Reform Act,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : The PLRA  infringes  upon the civil rights of incarcerated people by, among  other things, requiring exhaustion of the grievance process available within  the prison prior to bringing a federal lawsuit. This requirement also applies to  violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Jails and prisons have  purposefully designed their grievance processes to be matrices of confusion,  rendering them largely inaccessible by design. All tiers of grievance processes  must be completed in written English, making them nearly impossible for  those who do not know or who cannot read or write English for any reason.  ",Prison Litigation Reform Act,civil rights,ADA,violation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Disabled and deaf imprisoned people often need to receive accommodations  in their jail or prison under long-standing federal disability rights laws, but  they can rarely get through grievance processes — rendering it literally  impossible to utilize laws that were specifically established to guard against  disability-based discrimination found in every jail and prison across the  nation. Jails and prisons are known for not explaining the grievance process to  disabled people, claiming to not have necessary grievance forms, and  discarding completed grievances. Imprisoned people often cannot afford to  send forms to the necessary offices. All of this only further hamstrings  imprisoned people from gaining access to legal remedies. In addition, the  PLRA requires a showing of “physical injury,” which allows psychological,  emotional and sexual violence in prisons to continue unabated. It has taken  some deaf and disabled people  years  just to exhaust the administrative  remedy process with the support of attorneys. Retribution from prison  officials and staff for filing grievances is common,  adding to the harm  of the  lengthy and more often than not completely inaccessible process.

" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Rescinding the PLRA would greatly benefit disabled people.  4. The Truth in Sentencing Act and the Sentencing Reform Act must  be rescinded so that imprisoned humans have a possibility of  rehabilitation and parole. No human shall be sentenced to Death by  Incarceration or serve any sentence without the possibility of  parole.  The front end of the criminal legal system consistently fails to provide  reasonable accommodations and modifications when interacting and working  with deaf and disabled people. That is to say, that law enforcement,  prosecutors, defense attorneys, diversion agencies and the courts create a  system whereby disability is criminalized and disabled people are punished.

" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Sentences for disabled people are therefore disproportionately longer because  of systemic ableism. Additionally, the longer a person stays in prison, the  more likely they are to develop disabilities. Studies point to  exponential  increases  in the prison aging population. Sentences to  death in prison  (also  called, “life without parole”) are inhumane and must be fought regardless of  age, but in the meantime we can also fight for age and disability to be taken  into consideration determining eligibility for release, especially when evidence  proves that prisons will not provide adequate care and accommodations for  disabled and elder incarcerated populations.  5. An immediate end to the racial overcharging, over-sentencing,  and parole denials of Black and Brown humans. Black humans  shall no longer be denied parole because the victim of the crime  was white, which is a particular problem in Southern states.

" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Disability-, race- and class-based oppressions are now and always have been  inextricably linked. Notably, disabled people are disproportionately  represented within every marginalized community that exists. This is  especially true in communities beset by poverty, violence and deprivation of  other vital and life-enhancing and sustaining resources (food, water, health  and mental healthcare, education, living wages, etc.). An end to race- and  class-based inequities within carceral systems would greatly benefit disabled  people.  6. An immediate end to racist gang enhancement laws targeting  Black and Brown humans.  As argued in relation to the fifth demand above, any decrease in or end to  race- and class-based inequities within carceral systems will  disproportionately benefit disabled people.  7. No imprisoned human shall be denied access to rehabilitation  programs at their place of detention because of their label as a  violent offender.",intersectionality,disabled people,rehabilitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Prior to contact with carceral systems, many people have tried and failed to  access addiction and mental health supports, for example. Due to the lack of  access to services and supports, and adequate legal counsel for people with  various disabilities — especially those who also are negatively racialized and  have no income or a low income — disabled people are disproportionately  among those labeled as “violent offenders.”  Relatedly, in  prisons across the nation , deaf, blind and other disabled people  are punished for not responding to auditory commands or following rules that  were never conveyed to them in an accessible manner. Disabled people often  experience mental and emotional crises from communication deprivation and  other abuse. Additionally, disabled people in jails and prisons are  punished for  behaviors  that are obvious symptoms of their disabilities. Thus, jails and  prisons often have disciplinary records that label disabled people as “violent,”  which merely reflect the state’s illegal disability discrimination. These records  allow jails and prisons to continue to discriminate against disabled people by  locking them in solitary confinement, and further preventing access to  programming — even when programming is mandatory for release. All of this  leads to disabled people  spending more time in prison  than their abled  counterparts.  8. State prisons must be funded specifically to offer more  rehabilitation services.

" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Disability, trauma, violence and poverty  are all causes and consequences of  each other . Restorative and transformative practices should be implemented  to support the needs of the people that have been harmed, such as the 85  percent of incarcerated women that have experienced sexual violence. The  lack of these community-centered-and-led rehabilitative programs within  prisons actually perpetuates the need to build more prisons. For people  returning to our communities it becomes exponentially more difficult to  assimilate into a society without the proper tools to cope with the acquired  trauma from imprisonment. Incarceration without rehabilitation results in re- incarceration.  9. Pell grants must be reinstated in all US states and territories.

" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Intelligence is a  manufactured, racist-ableist concept  intended to reinforce  fictitious ideologies around Black and Indigenous inferiority. Its measurement  is an ever-shifting standard measured from whiteness that actively excludes  marginalized communities from accessing information via law, physical  violence, geographical placement and incarceration. A particular kind of  formalized education is almost requisite for access to even the most basic  opportunities in the United States.  ",intelligence,racism,ableism,whiteness,incarceration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Denying access to education while incarcerated or not allowing for financial  aid upon release is an evolution of anti-literacy laws, which denied enslaved  African peoples the right to read and write. A similar arrangement transpires  throughout auxiliary components of the prison system, specifically special  education programs in low-income communities. Students are often denied  education or provided with lower-quality education based on the label of  disability and are thus denied a fundamental human right. Students labeled as  disabled have the highest dropout  rates , are punished the  most , and are  funneled into the prison system at  rates higher  than any other marginalized  group. Once imprisoned, disabled and deaf people who already were deprived  of education in traditional school settings often attempt to enter prison  educational programing just to be told that their scores are too low for them to  enter prison educational programs. This only perpetuates social inequity.  ",denial,education,incarcerated people,disabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : To the detriment of disabled people, education and prison systems alike are  deciding who is worthy of an education. Learning is central to the processes of  growth and rehabilitation. Rather than implementing programs to encourage  education, prison systems have focused on banning books deemed “too  dangerous” or only allowing books from  selected companies  inside of prisons.    Accessible and high-quality education access, funding and programming in  prisons would greatly benefit disabled people.  10. The voting rights of all confined citizens serving prison  sentences, pretrial detainees, and so-called “ex-felons” must be  counted. Representation is demanded. All voices count.",disabled people,education,prison,rehabilitation,ableism,voting rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How Disability Issues Relate to the 10 Prison : Disenfranchisement of disabled people and people with criminal convictions  has always been  tied together  — in both law and social practice. For the state,  deprivation of the vote for disabled, imprisoned and formerly imprisoned  people is the ultimate checkmate. The devastating impact of incarceration is  most prevalent in the same communities that experience the most pervasive  voter suppression, including felon disenfranchisement, voter purging, strict ID  requirements, closing down of polling places with little or no notice and  prison  gerrymandering . Voter suppression tactics have always disproportionately  targeted disabled people; whether through guardianship laws,  inaccessible  polling locations  and equipment, or institutionalization. The voting bloc of  currently incarcerated and other institutionalized people ( and re entrants )  could radically transform the landscape of our society for the better. More  importantly, incarceration status should not affect the right to have a say in  the matters directly impacting them.

" The Time for Solidarity Is Now : Mass incarceration  is  a disability rights issue. :  The failure of disability communities to act in solidarity with racial, economic  and prison justice communities harms all marginalized communities.  Similarly, the failure of non-disability communities to name and address  disability justice issues also harms all marginalized communities.

" The Time for Solidarity Is Now : This massive undertaking in the name of human and civil rights is being led by  incarcerated people spanning across every demographic (disability included),  in solidarity with people on the outside. Many of the incarcerated people who  are currently engaged in work stoppages, sit-ins, hunger strikes, canteen  boycotts, and other forms of protest will face harsh retribution, including  solitary confinement, deprivation of food, violence, denied visits and calls, the  stripping of privileges and longer sentences. Those on the outside who act in  solidarity risk a great deal less than our incarcerated comrades. Now is the  time to practice disability solidarity. There are four days remaining. It’s time  to assess what we each can do for justice’s sake.
