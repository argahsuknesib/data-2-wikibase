" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : Many people quote my  definition of ableism  without providing context into what it means to say that  ableism is  formed and informed  by anti-Blackness.: ",ableism,Black,language,ableism,anti-Black racism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : Many also say, sign, write these words without providing necessary nuance about what this truth means for  how ableism is uniquely wielded against Black people. So while people finally seem to be coming around to  believing that ableism is inherently anti-Black, they are still gliding right past how this heart connection between  ableism and racism means that ableism hits real different for Black people and racism hits real different for  Black disabled people. Relatedly, many people have asked me why I do not use the term ""anti-Black ableism.""  I am encouraged by attempts to integrate these truths into folks' analysis of ableism and by continued  curiosity. I also want to name that we still must collectively develop more nuanced words, signs and  frameworks for these conversations to be had appropriately and justly.

" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : I will offer a bit here and expand if/when I have more capacity and more thoughts. Black disabled people,  especially, are encouraged to think and language and build and convene and discuss and challenge so we can  collectively come into more understandings of ourselves our experiences our journeys our hearts.   I will begin here: Anti-black racism exists because “anti-Black” modifies racism, a word and practice that can  and does apply to various and multiple negatively racialized groups. For instance, Native/Black peoples, Latinx  peoples, Hmong peoples all experience racism specific to complexion, appearance, cultural, community,  religious, and other practices, etc. Similarly,  misogynoir  expands on a particular kind of misogyny—the kind  which is experienced by Black women/femmes.",Black,disabled people,language,anti-Black racism,misgynoir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : But why would we use “anti-Black” to modify ableism when by its definition, at least in the US context, anti- Blackness is at the heart of ableism?  See working definition of ableism  here , and context for this  definition  here In short, since ableism is inherently anti-Black, I try my best not use the term ""anti-Black"" to modify ableism.  ""Anti-Black ableism"" is redundant and contradictory simultaneously. That sounds weird, I know. It's because  ableism and anti-Blackness are mutually inclusive and mutually dependent. So you can't have one without the  other and you also can't adjectively modify one with the other because where one is they both must be. Each  oppression does modify how a person experiences the other oppression, so they do modify the other in the  literal sense.

" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : That said, I really do appreciate that ""anti-Black ableism"" has been developed to try to focus on how Black non- disabled people, Black disabled people, and Black people who are labeled disabled (in good or in bad faith) are  treated in every since of the word. I know that there is something more needed to make this very unique  experience that Black people have with ableism more clear. Still, I believe “anti-Black ableism” does not  succeed in achieving the necessary clarity and that it may cause more harm to the effort being sought by those  using the term.

" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : There is no doubt that ableism absolutely hits different when wielded against Black people and Black  communities. It’s justification of deprivation, depravity, murder and mayhem against Black/disabled peoples. It’s  debasement, dehumanization and mass murder of the cruelest intensity and largest magnitude. All “justified” by  racialized notions of delinquency, dependency, defectiveness as determined by white supremacists and their  governments, corporations, medical/carceral institutions that directly and indirectly benefit from continued  subjugation and criminalization, extraction and commodification, diagnosing and destruction of our most  marginalized people and communities.  We must find ways to name how ableism is uniquely felt and experienced by Black people or we are not doing  justice to how the long term inescapable and inextricable bond between racism and ableism places Black non- disabled people, Black disabled people, and Black people who are labeled “disabled” in mortal danger with no  recourse.",ableism,racism,Black communities,anti-Black racism,disability,state violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" why I don't use ""anti-Black ableism"" (& language longings): by Talila A. Lewis : I do wonder what other Black disabled folks thoughts are on this. What word or phrase can be collectively  created to explain how Black people experience a racially magnified or racially manipulated or informed  ableism?
