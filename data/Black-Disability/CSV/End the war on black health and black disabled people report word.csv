" END THE WAR ON BLACK HEALTH AND BLACK DISABLED PEOPLE : One quarter of the Black population in the United States, 35% of Black people aged 44-65, and  almost half of Black people over 65, have some form of documented disability.   A history of systemic racism, ableism, medical violence, and neglect within the health care  system, combined with denial of universal, affordable, competent and quality care, has placed  access to medical care out of reach for the majority of Black people. Additionally, in the current  political climate, Black women, trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming people are  increasingly being denied access to full sexual, gender, and reproductive autonomy.

" THE DEMAND: : Universal health care is more than Medicare for All. Our entire health care system must be  reorganized to ensure the physical, mental, and spiritual health, well-being, self-determination,  agency, and autonomy of Black people, to eliminate profiteering insurance, pharmaceutical, and  medical equipment industries, and to create conditions that will allow healing of our bodies,  minds and spirits, and of the generational trauma which contributes to the war on Black health. :  We believe all Black people deserve excellent, free, equitable, and easily and physically  accessible health care, delivered with dignity, and free from entanglement with systems of  surveillance, policing, and punishment. We are entitled to health care that meets the full  dimension of our health needs, including body, mind, spiritual, reproductive and emotional care,  and particularly the needs of women, pregnant, LGBTQ+, intersex, disabled, and low-income  people, workers, youth, and elders.

" THE DEMAND: : KEY FEDERAL LEGISLATION:  Medicare for All (2019) Act  EMPOWER Care Act  Disability Integration Act  CARE Act  Repeal HIV Discrimination Act  Introduction  We demand an end to the longstanding, generational war on Black people’s health and  wellbeing, and to the war on Black disabled people.   Legacies of the transatlantic slave trade, enslavement, and ongoing systemic and structural anti- Black racism—including racial capitalism, misogynoir, ableism, transphobia, homophobia,  xenophobia, state-sponsored and sanctioned medical experimentation on Black people’s bodies,  environmental racism, segregation, and food, housing, and healthcare apartheid—have had  profound, lasting, and devastating effects on the individual and collective health and wellbeing  of people of African descent in the United States. These conditions have contributed to high rates  of both acute and chronic health conditions among Black people, and to systemic denial and lack  of access to comprehensive and affirming medical care.

" THE DEMAND: : As a result, Black people across the U.S. have shorter life expectancies, higher rates of stress- related medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease, unmet mental  health needs, and of chronic health issues, devastating rates of Black maternal and infant  mortality, and high rates of mortality among our trans and gender nonconforming family.   These forces have simultaneously constructed, projected, produced, and pathologized disability  across generations, resulting in systemic abuse, neglect, incarceration, institutionalization, and  social and structural exclusion of Black disabled people.  One quarter of the Black population in the United States, 35% of Black people aged 44-65, and  almost half of Black people over 65, have some form of documented disability.

" THE DEMAND: : Ableism is a central and essential feature of anti-Black racism. Throughout U.S. history,  resistance to slavery and anti-Black racism, as well as our natural responses to conditions of  enslavement and white supremacy, such as forced labor, systemic torture, rape, deprivation,  family separation, isolation, and the violence of policing, surveillance, institutionalization, and  criminalization,, have been pathologized. As a result, Black people have been systematically  labeled as mentally and developmentally disabled, and incarcerated in psychiatric institutions  and state “hospitals” to be tortured, abused, neglected, ostracized and demonized. Ableism also  contributes to filicide of disabled children.

" THE DEMAND: : Mental disabilities (including cognitive, intellectual, developmental and psychiatric disabilities)  continue to be projected onto Black people, contributing to high rates of state violence, including  police violence against and murders of Black people who are, or are perceived to be, in mental  health crisis – or who are responding to police violence. Black people who are, or are perceived  to be, mentally disabled are subjected to high levels of surveillance, stripped of our civil rights  through guardianship and civil commitment proceedings, and criminalized and incarcerated in  prisons and state hospitals and institutions, including “nursing facilities” and group “homes.”  Black people with—or who are framed as having—physical and mental disabilities also  experience high levels of impoverishment resulting from structural exclusion from education,  living wage employment, income support programs, and social and political institutions, as well  as high rates of sexual, domestic, and interpersonal violence. We are often unable to access  social services and spaces of support, and are reliant on a profit-driven health care system which  fails to meet our most basic needs, and is rooted in anti-Black racism.

" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : The medical-industrial complex plays a central role in promoting and enacting anti-Black racism.   During slavery and throughout U.S. history, people of African descent have consistently been  subject to systemic medical experimentation, medical abuse and neglect. This includes  widespread experimentation on the bodies of Black women by J. Marion Sims, who purposefully  withheld anesthesia, which served as the foundation of the field of gynecology. Even in death,  Black bodies were not sacred. During the Jim Crow era, white medical schools often pillaged  Black cemeteries for bodies to use for teaching and research, including the body of a Black  intersex woman stolen to prove that “hermaphrodites” existed. Anti-Black racism is also evident  in more recent state-sponsored medical experimentation on Black people such as the Tuskegee  syphilis experiment, use of Henrietta Lacks’ DNA for scientific research without her family’s  knowledge or consent, and ongoing testing of long-acting reproductive control (LARC) methods  on women of African descent domestically and globally.   : ",medical industrial complex,anti-Black racism,history,Black women,meidcal racism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : Anti-Black racism also manifests in the racialized construction of disease and disability, which  frames conditions such as HIV and substance dependence as “Black,” and others, such as polio  and multiple sclerosis, as “white.” As a result, conditions racialized as Black (or “other” as in the  case of coronavirus, for example) are met with criminalization and exclusion instead of research  and resources, and Black people with conditions racialized as white are met with neglect.   Eugenics, scientific racism, ableism, and population control policies created and promoted by the  medical profession and public health institutions, have produced a culture in which Black  women, queer, trans, intersex, gender nonconforming, disabled people, youth and elders have  systematically been pathologized, excluded, invisibilized, and abandoned.

" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : Additionally, Black women, disabled, queer, trans, and incarcerated people have been subjected  to forced or coerced sterilization as part of a genocidal project aimed at controlling Black  disabled bodies and reproduction in service of racial capitalism. Once the birth of Black children  was no longer seen as profitable, including children of disabled parents, who were deemed  unlikely to become “productive,” the state sought to prevent their existence.

" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : Because the medical-industrial complex was built on experimentation, “treatment” as  punishment, and violence against Black bodies, it remains a violent and neglect-filled space to  navigate for Black people. Additionally, accessing health care has been, and increasingly serves  as, a site of criminalization in the context of the war on migrants, the war on drugs, limitations  on exercises of gender, sexual, and reproductive autonomy, and the war on disabled, trans,  intersex, and gender nonconforming people. In the absence of comprehensive and affordable  medical coverage, the medical system is also the primary driver of debt, absence of wealth  accumulation, and poverty in Black families and communities. As a result, access to health care  remains both severely limited and fraught for Black people in the United States, with profound  impacts on our health and wellbeing. These effects are compounded by those of us  struggling to  survive in an anti-Black society.

" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : ANTI-BLACK RACISM AS A DETERMINANT OF HEALTH  Black people in the United States exist in a culture of anti-Black violence and negligence that  chronically affects our health and wellness. The cumulative effects of structural violence,  deprivation, and exclusion, combined with medical abuse and neglect, have resulted in sustained,  generational wear and tear, described as “weathering.” Weathering is a term used to refer to the  allostatic load of chronic stress induced by systemic racism on Black people’s bodies and minds,  particularly among Black people surviving at the intersections of multiple and intersecting  systems of oppression, including Black disabled people, Black low/no income people, Black  women, Black LGB+ and Black trans, intersex, and gender nonconforming people. These effects  are compounded for Black criminalized and incarcerated people and for Black migrants, who  experience additional stresses of being hunted, violated, and caged by the state, and for whom  medical care is largely inaccessible to the point of being virtually non-existent.

" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : BLACK LEADERSHIP IN THE FIGHT FOR UNIVERSAL ACCESSIBLE  COMPREHENSIVE, AND LIBERATORY HEALTH CARE.   Black people have been fighting for universal health care since at least the late 1800s. We lift up  the traditions of Black healers, midwives, caregivers, and freedom fighters who have provided  affirming, free, or low-cost care to our communities throughout our history in the U.S. to the best  of their abilities, in the face of widespread medical abandonment, abuse and neglect.  We lift up the visions, analysis, and leadership of our Black disabled family. We embrace and  advance a vision of disability justice rooted in Sins Invalid’s 10 Principles of Disability Justice  that challenges the ways in which society, by and through racial capitalism, tethers our value to  production, and renders Black disabled people vulnerable to forced labor, exploitation, and harm  through “sheltered workshops” and prison and work release programs.

" RACIST ROOTS OF THE MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : Disability justice asserts the inherent worth of all individuals beyond capitalist notions of  productivity, and affirms that no body or mind can be left behind in our quest for Black  liberation.   We recognize the many ways that ableism, including, audism, sanism, and able-bodied  supremacy, constructs, and is an essential element of, anti-Blackness, white supremacy,  cisheteropatriarchy, and other structures and forms of oppression. Disability justice requires all  of us to commit to creating a culture of interdependence and collective access. We are committed  to uprooting ableist structures and power, culture, and practices in our communities, and in our  movements for Black liberation.
