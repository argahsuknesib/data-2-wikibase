" I'm a Black, Trans, Disabled : Model — And I Just Got : Signed to a Major Agency  September 4, 2018  My name is Aaron Philip. I’m 17 years old, I live in the Bronx, and I’m about to be  a senior in high school! I identify as a gender-nonconforming trans woman who  uses she/her pronouns. I also have cerebral palsy and use a motorized  wheelchair to get around. As of September 1, I’m also one of Elite New York  City’s newest models, and am about to participate in my first season in New  York. : ",transgender,Black woman,disabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I'm a Black, Trans, Disabled : Model — And I Just Got : I enter the fashion world with intentions of making the industry more diverse,  inclusive, and accessible. I have never seen a physically disabled supermodel or  a Black transfeminine model heralded, celebrated, or even working in the way  other models are — and I hope to change that. This lack of representation and  visibility in fashion has deeply affected me throughout my life, and has driven me  to take matters into my own hands to carve a space and try to provide  opportunity for members of my community in this field. And while this might  sound inspiring to some, to me it’s simply a matter of showing the world  something different, and opening people’s minds — especially in fashion, where  there’s a fine line between art and consumerism.

" I'm a Black, Trans, Disabled : Model — And I Just Got : As a person, I wear my identity on my sleeve. Coming into this industry as one of  two models in wheelchairs signed to a major modeling agency (the other being  my angel & good friend Jillian Mercado) while being Black and transfeminine is  both very empowering and sort of terrifying. And like any other model, I have  many aspirations. I dream of Miu Miu, Chanel, Dior, Calvin Klein, and Prada  while I’m sleeping. I live vicariously through the shows of Helmut Lang, Versace,  Eckhaus Latta, Balenciaga, and Givenchy. Fashion is important to me because  it’s the ultimate form of conveying self-expression and toying with gender. The  possibility of creating opportunities for disabled and gender-nonconforming  people in high fashion is what excites me about being in this industry.

" I'm a Black, Trans, Disabled : Model — And I Just Got : Now that I’m signed and ready to hit the runway this season, I have lots of  questions running through my mind.  Who will be daring enough to cast me in  their shows? Will I book any shows this season? Which casting directors are  interested or uninterested?  As excited as I am, this is all new to me. I know that  because of my appearance, my disability, and my identities, I may be boxed into  a position where I’m either seen as unique and fascinating, or straight  up  not  what a casting director or designer may be looking for. More than  anything, I can only pray for success and happiness within my career and the  goals I intend to achieve. I don’t want signings like mine to be a trend or a fad. I  want careers for Black, disabled, and trans models to be attainable and  sustainable.  ",Black,career,disability,transgender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I'm a Black, Trans, Disabled : Model — And I Just Got : While I work toward my goals, it’s nice to reflect on the fact that I’m here to  celebrate myself, my communities, and my friends who work in this business. I’m  so very honored to be chasing and achieving my dreams. I hope that one day  soon, trans and disabled models will be able to reach the level of success any  other talented and hardworking model can. I won’t settle for anything less.  See you on the runway.  ",transgender,disabled,community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
