" Black Disability Gone Viral: : A Critical Race Approach to Inspiration Porn  Sami Schalk  On May 31, 2018, tattoo artist Milton Purnell of Tattoo Supreme in Ra- leigh, North Carolina  posted a striking video on his Instagram and Face- book pages. The video shows Purnell presenting  Michael Mack, Jr., a ten-year-old Black boy amputee, with a new prosthetic leg. The leg features  custom airbrush artwork, with white and silver flames around the name and image of the Black  Panther, the Marvel superhero from the blockbuster film, Black Panther (2018). The video captures  young Mack’s eyes growing wide with excitement, as Purnell shows him the prosthetic, asking the  boy what he thinks of it. Suddenly, Mack’s jaw drops. He spins off the stool he is seated on and  hops away briefly, with his hand over his mouth. He then returns to his seat, where he grasps the  leg in his hands, admiring it. In the background, two voices, including Mack’s mother, Sandra Mc-  Neill, express awe and admiration for the custom artwork. In front of the camera, Purnell  encourages Mack to try it on, stating “Put yo leg on man! Put yo leg on!” In the background, we  hear McNeill saying that she forgot the “connecting part” for the new leg, but that Mack should  still put it on for a picture. Mack puts on the prosthetic, stands up, and starts to dance. Within days,  this video went viral, with hundreds of thousands of views, shares, likes, and comments across  multiple social media platforms. : ",social media,disability,Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability Gone Viral: : Whenever a video, image, or story of a disabled person goes viral, it most of- ten occurs within  the context of inspiration porn, a term popularized by the late Australian disability rights activist  Stella Young. Generally, inspiration porn refers to representations that “objectify disabled people  for the benefit of non-disabled people.” The term, which has taken strong hold within disability  and activist com- munities, is beginning to appear in academic scholarship, and was even featured  in an episode of the ABC sitcom Speechless in 2017. Inspiration porn has strong similarities to the  older concept of supercrip, a term used to describe narratives about disabled people who are  represented as inspiring or extraordinary for performing both mundane and exceptional activities.  ",inspiration porn,disabled person,context,supercrip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability Gone Viral: : Inspiration porn and supercrip narratives are similar in several ways. Both concepts rely on certain  affective registers, such as inspiration, awe, tragedy, tri- umph, and pity; they also presume a non- disabled audience and engage ableist concepts, such as overcoming or compensating for the  perceived obstacle caused by disability. They are also both narrative frameworks. That is, the  people represented in these images and stories are not themselves supercrips nor inspiration porn,  but rather supercrip and inspiration porn frameworks are applied to rep- resent people and their  stories in this way. There are a few differences between inspiration porn and supercrip narratives,  however. The main difference is that inspiration porn often includes representations of non- disabled people “helping” disabled people, an approach not typically considered part of supercrip  narratives. Inspiration porn is also used primarily in reference to memes, photos, videos, and news  stories that are shared on the internet, whereas the term supercrip has most often been applied to  news stories and fictional representations.  ",inspiration porn,supercrip,nondisabled,ableism,disability,representation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability Gone Viral: : Scholarly work on inspiration porn and supercrip narratives lacks engagement with race. In most  cases, scholars never mention race and the objects of analysis represent white or non-racially  identified subjects. With a few exceptions, scholars do allude to race, such as in Russell Meeuf ’s  footnote acknowledging that his analysis of John Wayne as supercrip is specifically focused on  white masculinity and my argument that Christopher Reeve’s racial and class privilege is often  overlooked in representations of him as supercrip. In both cases, racial privilege is acknowledged  as a constitutive factor in supercrip narratives, but race is not a central analytic of the scholarship.  Relatedly, only a few scholars have analyzed how audience identity impacts the reception and  interpretation of representations of disabled people, while focusing primarily on how disabled  people at large respond, as opposed to disabled people of color or people of color more generally.  ",inspiration porn,supercrip,race,disabled people,analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability Gone Viral: : A major exception to this trend is a blog post titled, “White Privilege & Inspiration Porn,” by  activist Vilissa Thompson, in which she responds to white dis- abled critiques of the story of Anaya  Ellick, a Black disabled girl who won a penmanship contest, as inspiration porn. Thompson argues  that, although she too is critical of inspiration porn, sometimes she does share stories on social  media that have an inspirational bent to them. As a Black disabled woman, Thompson asserts that  she does “not have the ‘luxury’ of picking and choosing stories that depict us [Black disabled  people] in a positive, non-inspirational light...each time we read about a Black disabled person and  it is not about us being victimized, traumatized, or killed, we hold tight to those stories because we  see a part of ourselves.” Thompson’s post provides insight into how the race and (dis)ability  identities of the individuals in a representation, as well as those of the audience, can impact the  reception of potential inspiration porn. Her arguments also provide a starting point for my own:  that inspiration porn, as it is currently understood in activist and academic circles alike, is primarily  a “White Disability Studies” concept that ultimately operates differently within Black and other  racialized experiences and representations of disability.  ",white privilege,inspiration porn,Black women,disabled,race,disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability Gone Viral: : I argue that Disability Studies scholars have yet to adequately explore how race may necessitate  adapting our understandings of inspiration porn. More broadly, I contend that Disability Studies  needs to grapple with how non-white racial con- texts may necessitate shifting or discarding certain  terms and concepts in the field that have been almost exclusively developed and deployed in the  context of white experiences, understandings, and representations of disability. This argument  matters not only for Black and Critical Race Disability Studies scholars who need to examine the  utility of concepts and theories in white Disability Studies for our work, but also for Disability  Studies scholars working on white experiences, understandings, and representations of disability.  These scholars, I argue, need to be more explicit in naming the objects of their analysis as  exclusively white, acknowledging the potential that their concepts will not translate to other racial  contexts.  ",Disability Studies,race,inspiration porn,context,Critical Race Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Disability Gone Viral: : In order to support these arguments, I use the viral story of Michael Mack, Jr.’s Black Panther  prosthetic leg as a case study for examining the impact of race on so- called inspirational  representations of disability. To do so, I first provide a timeline overview of how the Black Panther  prosthetic video and story circulated during the summer of 2018 in two relatively distinct,  racialized waves. Subsequently, I under- take a comparative analysis of the two waves of media  coverage. I demonstrate that while the first wave of coverage from Black digital media outlets  focused almost exclusively on Mack’s “Black boy joy” and the power of representation for Black  people, the second wave of coverage from mainstream, white, local news outlets conformed more  to the norms of inspiration porn by focusing on Mack’s disability and representing him as the  exceptional, yet passive recipient of non-disabled charity. Although almost all of the media  coverage of this story drew on similar positive affective registers like inspiration and joy, the  emphases and frameworks vary, predominantly along racial lines. The racial differences in framing  this viral video provide insight into how concepts within Disability Studies, like inspiration porn,  which have been primarily developed and deployed in regard to white experiences and  representations of disability, may need to be adjusted or discarded in the context of racialized  subjects to account for the specificity of cultural norms and racial histories.

" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : The concept of going viral is a relatively new one in our culture. In their book on the subject,  Karine Nahon and Jeff Hemsley write that going viral refers to “a naturally occurring, emergent  phenomenon facilitated by the interwoven collection of websites that allow users to host and share  content (e.g., YouTube, Insta- gram, Flickr), connect with friends and people with similar interests  (e.g., Face- book, Twitter), and share their knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia, blogs).” Typically, when  something goes viral, information in the form of a video or image is shared and viewed widely and  “with a speed and reach never before available to the vast majority of people.” Going viral is a  relatively subjective phenomenon in that opinions on what counts as viral in terms of reach (e.g.,  the numbers of views, likes, shares, or comments) and speed (i.e., how quickly those numbers rack  up after original posting) varies widely and changes frequently. While several thousand views or  shares may have constituted a viral video in the early days of social media in the early 2000s,  hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views or shares typically constituted going viral in 2018,  when the Black Panther prosthetic leg video was circulating. Although there is no way to predict  perfectly what content will go viral, the process does rely on the participation of gatekeepers, or  the “people, collectives, companies, or governments that, as a result of their location in a network,  can promote or suppress the movement of information from one part of a network to another.”  With regard to viral content created by average users, gatekeepers are typically media companies  and people, such as celebrities who possess a large social media reach and who share the content,  giving it the signal boost it needs to circulate widely. : ",viral,social media,media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : In this section, I provide a narrative timeline for the viral circulation of the Black Panther prosthetic  video to provide context for how Mack’s story initially circulated in essentially two waves. This  information is also displayed in Table 1 at the end of this essay. This narrative timeline  demonstrates how the video first circulated among Black media outlets and audiences, before  gaining a second wave of national attention among mainstream, white-dominated media outlets,  after a local news station interviewed Mack and his mother about the viral video.  ",methodology,context,media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : The initial gatekeeper signal boost for the video was provided on June 3, 2018, three days after  Purnell’s original posting. “Because of Them We Can” shared the video on Instagram, Facebook,  and Twitter, all with the same caption: “This young boy just got a new Black Panther-themed  prosthetic leg and his priceless reaction is enough to make your entire day,” followed by the  hashtags #blackboyjoy, #wakandaforever, and #becauseofthemwecan. “Because of Them We  Can” is a Black media outlet that Eunique Jones launched in 2013. The outlet emerged from her  “desire to share our rich history and promising future through images that would refute stereotypes  and build the esteem of our children.” It is important to note that the video first gained widespread  attention through a Black media outlet whose focus is on sharing positive representations of Black  people for a predominantly Black audience. This context likely helped shape the video’s  circulation and attending frameworks as it spread across the internet.  ",social media,#BlackBoyJoy,Black,media,context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : In the week after receiving the initial signal boost from “Because of Them We Can,” the Black  Panther prosthetic video gained additional coverage from seven Black media outlets, each with  moderate to major reach, particularly among Black people. First, Ebony and The Grio, two major  Black news and media outlets, covered the story on June 4, 2018 on their websites. Madame Noire  and Essence soon followed suit with stories on June 7 and 8, respectively. The video was then  featured in short news stories on several smaller Black popular culture media outlets between June  9 and 12, including Blavity, Bossip, and BCK Online. My research indicates that, although  individuals of many races viewed, shared, and commented on the video across various platforms,  only Black media outlets initially picked up the story.  ",Black ,media,race,context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : The particularity of these Black media outlets matters for any interpretation of how they represent  a Black disabled person. Publications like Ebony and Essence began as paper magazines that aimed  to represent Black people and their accomplishments in a positive light, often emphasizing middle- class values and an adherence to respectability politics. While other Black media outlets like The  Grio, Madame Noire, and Blavity are more recent and exclusively online, they also focus on Black  news, entertainment, and popular culture with a leftist, middle-class bent. Black media outlets,  therefore, often are invested in positive, uplifting, and even inspirational representations of Black  people, and this particular cultural context is essential to interpreting their coverage of Michael  Mack, Jr’s viral video.  ",Black ,media,Black people,context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : On June 13, 2018, Purnell’s video of Mack received a second wave of attention when Mack,  McNeill, and Purnell were all interviewed for the local news. WRAL, the NBC affiliate station in  Raleigh, sent reporter Bryan Mims to cover the story. The four minute and thirteen second segment  provides an overview of Mack’s personal story, as well as the story of how the Black Panther  prosthetic leg video went viral. Also, on June 13, 2018, Spectrum Local News Central North  Carolina posted a video segment about Mack that was just under two minutes in length. The next  day, WSOC-TV, the ABC affiliate station in Charlotte produced a segment about Mack, and few  days later, on June 18, WTVD, the ABC affiliate station in Durham, produced one as well. The  latter three, Spectrum News, WTVD, and WSOC-TV all appear to have used the WRAL original  interview footage, though each incorporated some sound bites that were not included in the final  version of the WRAL segment.  ",media,white,context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : Finally, between June 14 and June 18, 2018, the content produced by the local North Carolina  news stations, primarily those from WRAL and WTVD, were shared by a variety of news and  media outlets, including Yahoo Sports, The Root (the only Black news outlet in this wave of  coverage), and local news stations in Cincinnati, Chicago, and New York. With the exception of  The Root, all of the coverage in this wave emanated from more mainstream sources, with white  reporters in the videos creating content for a predominantly white audience. This context too  shapes the emphasis and approach taken in the coverage of the viral video in this second wave.  ",media,white,Black,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Video: A Viral Timeline : By late June, almost as quickly as it began, the viral attention faded away. To reiterate, there were  two major waves of media coverage of the Black Panther pros- thetic video: The first wave  occurred between June 3 and 12, when the video was featured and shared on numerous Black  media websites and social media accounts; the second wave occurred between June 13 and June  18, when Mack, McNeill, and Purnell were interviewed by local news station WRAL and the  interview footage was used to produce three other local news segments about Mack and the viral  video. These four local news segments were then replicated and shared by other local and national  media outlets. Having established this timeline of the viral video, in the next section I will  comparatively analyze the approaches of the two waves of media coverage in more detail.  ",context,Black,media,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Black Boy Joy Meets Inspiration Porn : The media coverage of Purnell’s video and of Mack himself is an excellent and illustrative example  of how race can impact the framing and reception of content that can be used as inspiration porn.  I want to emphasize “can be used” in the previous sentence because, like supercrip, inspiration  porn is a narrative frame- work for presenting content that includes people with disabilities. In  other words, images and videos of disabled people are not in and of themselves automatically  inspiration porn—a point I hope will become increasing clear as I analyze the differences in how  the video is framed and discussed in the first wave of coverage by Black media outlets versus the  second wave of coverage by local, mainstream media outlets. My aim is to both complicate our  understanding of inspiration porn, as well as consider whether the term is useful or applicable in  the context of non-white disabled people. : ",race,inspiration porn,supercrip,disabled people,Black,media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : The first wave of coverage by Black media outlets operated in a fairly consistent way, focusing on  two similar themes across the seven articles: Black boy joy and the power of positive  representations. As a whole, the media coverage in this wave focuses almost exclusively on race,  with little to no explicit attention to disability, while still relying on positive affect to induce  emotion in readers and viewers, as one would expect from inspiration porn. : ",Black ,media,#BlackBoyJoy,race,disability,inspiration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : Black boy joy is a social media term that is used to affirm that Black men and boys are allowed to  have a range of emotions and to reject the norms of toxic Black masculinity. The hashtag  #BlackBoyJoy was originally popularized by Chance the Rapper on an Instagram post in 2016 and  has since been used widely on social media to mark posts about and representations of happy Black  boys and men, similar to the use of #BlackGirlMagic for Black women and girls. Danielle Young  writes that the Black boy joy “hashtag is a celebration of black childhood and the innocence of it.  Black men rarely get the chance to revel in childhood or enjoy violence-free memories...[because]  throughout history, our boys have been denied their childhood.” #BlackBoyJoy was used by  “Because of Them We Can” during its first signal boost social media sharing of the Black Panther  prosthetic video and continued to appear in most Black media outlet coverage of Mack’s viral  video. This particular cultural context matters deeply to any interpretation of the use of positive  affect in media cover of the Black Panther prosthetic leg viral video.  ",#BlackBoyJoy,Black maculinity,context,representation,context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : The Black boy joy hashtag appears directly in the title of The Grio article and the phrase is used  in the body of the articles in Ebony, Madame Noire, and BCK Online, collectively representing  over half of the first wave of media coverage. Throughout these articles, the emphasis is primarily  on Mack’s emotional response at seeing the Black Panther prosthetic for the first time, rather than  on his “overcoming” disability or on a non-disabled person helping him. This distinction matters,  because readers and viewers are invited to share in Mack’s joy, rather than be inspired or moved  by his mere existence or survival. As the Madame Noir article title asserts “This Young Boy’s  Reaction To Receiving A Black Panther Prosthetic Leg Will Blow You Away.” In other words,  the articles frame the video as something that makes Black people feel good or hopeful in response  to a positive representation of a Black child rather than, as inspiration porn does, use a  representation of the disabled Other to make those with ability privilege feel better about or more  appreciative of their lives. It is important, therefore, in analyzing the use of positive affect in this  wave of coverage, to distinguish between emotional frameworks that perpetuate ableist notions  that disabled people are in need of help or pity and emotional frameworks like Black boy joy which  use positive representations of Black men and boys to resist racist ideologies of Black masculinity.  One cannot conflate the way Black media outlets refer to the video as “heartwarming” and other  similar terminology with the ableist positive affect created by inspiration porn. To do so would  ignore the important cultural context of Black media’s history of racial uplift as a goal and the  contemporary social media use of positive representations of Black people as inspiration for one  another through concepts like Black boy joy and Black girl magic.  ",disability,#BlackBoyJoy,inspiration porn,representation,Black masculinity,Black,media,ableist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : The second central theme of the Black media outlet coverage of the Black Panther prosthetic viral  video is the power of representation. While all of the articles in this wave mention either Black  Panther or Wakanda, the fictional un-colonized African nation in the film (or both), four of the  seven articles, Ebony, Madame Noir, Essence and BCK Online, specifically discuss the  importance and power of this positive representation for Black people. The article in Essence, for  example, states that Black Panther “had a significant impact on young Black people who finally  saw themselves on the big screen as superheroes for the very first time” and concludes with the  assertion that “it’s clear Black Panther will continue to have a positive im- pact on our lives, and  more importantly our young people’s lives, for years to come. #WakandaForever.” Research  shows that media representations can significantly impact self-perceptions and self-esteem among  marginalized groups. In this wave of coverage Black media outlets emphasize that Mack’s joyful  surprise at seeing his Black Panther prosthetic is illustrative of the empowering role media can  have for Black people, especially Black children.  ",Black ,media,representation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : As my discussion of these themes suggests, positive affect was used in the first wave of media  coverage of the viral video in a way that is racially affirming and up- lifting, rather than blatantly  ableist. For instance, two articles in this wave use the word “inspiration,” but both use it to refer  to how Purnell drew inspiration from Black Panther to create the artwork for the prosthetic leg.  Similar to the assertions of the power of representation, these uses of inspiration draw directly on  how this powerful, positive representation of Black heroes and heroines can inspire Black people  to view and imagine themselves outside of colonialism and white supremacy. This kind of  inspiration is distinct from that of inspiration porn, which uses disabled people (a marginalized  group) to inspire non-disabled people (a privileged group) to appreciate their lives/bodies or work  harder at achieving their goals. In this case, the articles note the importance of marginalized people  creating representations that inspire and empower people within that same marginalized group. In  Disability Studies, some scholars have similarly questioned blanket rejection of inspiration used  in response to disabled people to consider how inspiration may work within disability  communities.  ",ableism,Black,inspiration porn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : While I contend that the general use of inspiration and positive affect in this wave of media  coverage was not “inspiration porn,” this does not mean that these representations were not ableist  in another, racially specific way. Across this first wave, the Black media outlets emphasized race  and paid little to no attention to disability—the words amputee and disabled (and any variation on  these words) were never used, though the word prosthetic did appear and Mack’s disability was  visually apparent and centered in the viral video itself. Disability was not erased so much as it was  left uncommented upon. Only the article from The Grio draws explicit attention to Mack’s  disability, stating in the final sentence: “We’re not sure what the circumstances are surrounding  Mikey’s situation on how he lost his leg.” This direct reference to Mack’s disability is incredibly  brief, but does gesture to- ward the ableist impulse to know the origins of a person’s disability. Of  course, prior to the WRAL interview, people writing about the video had no additional information  about Mack or his disability to include, so it’s impossible to know if such information would have  been included if it had been available.  ",representation,ableism,inspiration porn,disability,Black,media,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : For the first wave of Black media outlet coverage, disability was not the most important or  interesting part of the viral video, even as disability via Mack’s need for a new prosthetic was the  reason for the moment in the video occurring in the first place. Instead, for Black media outlets,  the appeal of the viral video was in Mack’s Black boy joy and in its demonstration of the power  of representation.   Nonetheless, the fact that disability wasn’t explicitly mentioned or engaged in the majority of the  Black media coverage is, I contend, ableist, even if ableist in a different way than inspiration porn.  Inspiration porn overemphasizes disability, but the refusal to recognize disability as a mutually  constitutive aspect of Mack’s identity and lived experience might suggest to viewers and readers  that disability is ultimately something that is shameful or private and thus should not be openly  discussed. ",Black,media,disability,ableism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Wave of Media Coverage : To understand this in the context of Blackness, we might consider how there is a cultural norm of  distancing one’s self from disability identity in Black com- munities due to: 1) histories of  disabling racial violence that make disability commonplace in many Black communities and, 2)  histories of justifying of racism via discourses of disability, which position all Black people as  inherent disabled in comparison to whites. This racial context and history is essential to any  interpretation of the lack of explicit engagement with disability in the first wave of black media  coverage. We can identify the ableist ideologies of shame and stigma that may be influencing this  erasure of disability, but those ideologies cannot be separated from the racialized history of  disability and the disabling history of race, especially when discussing representations of Black  disabled people by Black media outlets. This then is why a Critical Race approach to so-called  inspiration porn is so necessary and why I am arguing that the term itself may not be useful in a  Black Disability Studies context.

" Second Wave of Media Coverage : The second wave of media coverage with video interview segments from local news outlets  occurred between June 13 and June 18, 2018. It differed greatly from the first wave of coverage  from Black media outlets in that these news stories employed inspiration porn frameworks. By  comparing what the reporters say in the video about Mack and disability versus what Mack  expresses about being disabled, I highlight how inspiration porn functions as a narrative  framework applied to a person or representation that relies on certain ableist narrative mechanisms.  Further, by comparing this wave of media coverage to the previous one, I demonstrate how racial  context influences our understanding of inspiration porn. I contend that, in order to function,  inspiration porn must (over)emphasize disability and ignore or sideline race—something that is  accomplished more easily in regard to white disabled people, whose racialization typically remains  unmarked in the con- temporary United States. In other words, inspiration porn is most successful  when disability becomes the dominant identity within a representation and other identities such as  race are ignored, erased, or suppressed as part of the narrative. : ",inspiration porn,race,white,media,disabled people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Second Wave of Media Coverage : An inspiration porn framework was first employed in this wave of media coverage through its  focus on disability as a challenge to overcome. Three of the four video news stories in the second  wave of coverage, WRAL, WSOC-TV, and WTVD, include information about why and when  Michael Mack, Jr.’s leg was amputated, adhering to the ableist desire to know what happened, a  desire that conceives of disability primarily as loss, tragedy, and trauma, rather than as difference,  gain, or even just a neutral experience. Additionally, the WRAL and Spectrum News segments  both discuss how Mack has been bullied about his prosthetic leg as an example of the challenges  he still faces. Although Mack does admit that some kids who see his prosthetic “get a disgusted  look,” he also insists that now, with the new art- work, he believes other kids will “think it’s really  cool.” Nonplussed about those ableist stares, Mack makes it clear that he doesn’t see his  amputation as an obstacle. In the WRAL interview, when asked about his disability, Mack states  succinctly: “It hasn’t been a challenge at all.” When his mother interrupts to say, “Maybe not for  you, but it’s been a challenge for me,” Mack laughs, unfazed, and agrees: “Yea, it’s been a  challenge for her.” In this moment, it’s clear that Mack does not view himself as having overcome  anything, even as reporters employed inspiration porn frameworks to represent disability as the  dominant, challenging force in his life. Reporters may have employed this approach because of his  age and perceived naivety or because of their own ableist beliefs that life with a disability is  inherently difficult or painful.  ",inspiration porn,disability,ableism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Second Wave of Media Coverage : Inspiration porn would not be “inspirational,” however, if it stopped at representing the disabled  subject as pitiful and tragic. This narrative framework becomes insidious because it presents itself  as positive and uplifting, as celebrating disabled people even as it still perpetuates ableist ideas of  disability as a pitiful tragedy to be overcome through exceptional effort. This turn to inspiration  occurred in the second wave of media coverage. Across all four news segments, Mack was  described by what Silva and Howe in their work on supercrip narratives call “superlative  terminology.” The use of superlative terminology that exceptionalized Mack in this wave of media  coverage relied on low social expectations for what disabled people can do and focused more on  his attitude and presumed overcoming than on the societal and environmental barriers that shape  his experience as a Black disabled boy in a racist, ableist world. For example, in this wave of local  news stories, Mack was referred to as “an amazing young man” who looks and feels like a  superhero, but “needs no suit to be a shining light to others,” as he refuses to let an “amputation  hold him back.”  The language throughout the local news stories positioned Mack as the exception to some ableist  rule that disabled people should be passive, sad, drab, and hidden away at home. Further, the  WSOC-TV and WTVD interviews both claim that Mack hopes to be a “spokesperson” for other  children with amputations and inspire them. Although Mack is never directly quoted using the  words spokesperson or inspire, in the WSOC-TV interview, he does say that it would “be cool to  help out other kids in need with this type of stuff.” While it is unclear if “this type of stuff ” refers  to amputations specifically or disabilities generally, it is notable that Mack says “kids in need.”  Although it is likely that reporters included this quote to attempt to demonstrate Mack’s supposed  desire to be a role model who inspires all disabled/amputee children, it seems just as plausible that  Mack uses “in need” to refer to financial need. After all, in the same interview Mack asserts,  “amputee kids, they can pretty much do anything,” suggesting he doesn’t believe that all other kids  with similar disabilities need his help or inspiration. As a whole, the superlative language that  frames Mack as exceptional, while seemingly positive and uplifting, ultimately relies on additional  oppressive ableist ideologies about disabled people.  ",inspiration porn,representation,disabled people,ableism,supercrip,language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Second Wave of Media Coverage : Finally, the media coverage in the second wave employed an inspiration porn framework by  rhetorically positioning Mack as the passive recipient of generosity. In the WRAL interview, Mack  states that his mother encouraged him to get the Black Panther artwork on his prosthetic. This  suggests that, while he was indeed surprised and overjoyed with the final results, as depicted in  the original viral video, the artwork was commissioned, likely paid for, and originally the idea of  mother and son. Nonetheless, the titles of the local news stories all state that Purnell surprised  Mack with the custom prosthetic or refer to Mack as receiving or being given the prosthetic. This  is particularly apparent in the case of WTVD, which featured Mack as an “ABC 11 Together”  story, a segment which “highlights the strength of the human spirit, good deeds, community needs,  and how our viewers can help.”  By putting this story in the “Together” segment, WTVD suggests that either Mack is an example  of the strength of the human spirit (relying on concepts of overcoming) or that Purnell creating  custom artwork is an example of a local good deed. In comparison, the titles from the first wave  of media coverage did not mention Purnell at all and predominantly positioned Mack as active,  stating that his reaction to getting his new prosthetic will “blow you away,” “make your day” and  “melt your heart.” The first wave black media outlet titles focus on Mack and his black boy joy  reaction while the second wave local news outlet titles frame the story as one of a generous,  nondisabled person providing a gift to a disabled child. While both approaches encourage positive  feelings in the audience, the latter approach relies on ableist ideas of disabled people as passive  object of charity.

" Second Wave of Media Coverage : Undoubtedly, the general trend in the media coverage of Michael Mack, Jr. and the Black Panther  prosthetic viral video in the second wave of media coverage leans heavily toward an inspiration  porn framework. The coverage in this wave promotes ableist, pity-inspired emotions among its  predominantly white viewers, standing in stark contrast to the first wave in which positive affect  was employed among a predominantly Black audience as a response to Mack’s Black boy joy at  seeing his new prosthetic, a reaction that exemplifies the power of positive representations for  Black people. Notably, The Root, the only Black media outlet to have conducted a story on Mack  in the second wave of coverage, is the only media outlet to explicitly address both Blackness and  disability in the same article. The piece opens with the statement “The cultural significance and  impact of Black Panther will never die” and, quoting from the WRAL interview, includes  information about why and when Mack’s leg was amputated. This coverage of “Mack’s fresh- as- all-hell leg” is the closest there is to an intersectional approach to the story that considers Black  disability as a distinct experience.

" Conclusion: Implications for Black Disability Studies : As my above comparative analysis of the first and second wave of media coverage of the Black  Panther prosthetic viral video demonstrates, there is a clear difference between how Black media  outlets and local new outlets approached the story. The differences in frameworks and narrative  mechanisms employed in the two waves are, I argue, primarily due to the different racial identities  of those in the video, those producing the coverage, and those in the intended audience. The im-  pact of race on the presentation and reception of a viral video of a disabled person is therefore  important to consider in any work on inspiration porn. My analysis here also demonstrates the  need to understand and discuss inspiration porn, like supercrip, as a narrative framework that relies  on certain narrative mechanisms to operate. Identifying how these various mechanisms appear and  function differently across racial groups is an essential part of developing Disability Studies  theoretical frameworks that refuse to be race-neutral and instead seek to understand how race,  including whiteness, shapes experiences, representations, and interpretations of disability. : ",analysis,Black,media,race,inspiration porn,supercrip,whiteness,Disability Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Conclusion: Implications for Black Disability Studies : Many concepts and theories of disability were developed through analysis of white disability only.  Applying these concepts and theories broadly without ac- counting for the nuances of a different  racial context can result in misinterpretations and faulty analysis. For instance, if one merely looks  at the fact that the majority of the Black media outlets took a positive emotional spin on the story  by using phrases like “heart-warming,” one might be inclined to label this coverage inspiration  porn. But as my analysis demonstrates, the use of positive affect in the first wave coverage was  primarily in relationship to concepts of Black boy joy and the power of positive representation  rather than as an explicit response to disability. This Black cultural context is essential to  interpreting the role of affect in the first wave of media coverage and much would be lost without  it.

" Conclusion: Implications for Black Disability Studies : This does not, of course, mean that the representations of the Black Panther prosthetic viral video  in the first wave of coverage by black media outlets were not ableist. Indeed, I contend that the  avoidance of an engagement with disability in the Black media stories may very well reflect the  stigma and shame surrounding acknowledgement of disability in Black communities. However,  this racially con- textualized form of ableism is not the same as that expressed in inspiration porn.  Since inspiration porn relies heavily on the (over)emphasis on disability above all other identities  and Black media coverage attends primarily to Black identity first, I argue that this term is not as  useful in analyzing Black media representations of disabled people that use inspiration and other  forms of positive affect. We can and should be critical of the erasure or avoidance of disability  identity and disability politics in the Black media coverage and push for better recognition of racial  and disability identities within all media coverage of Black disabled people, but in this case, simply  calling these various representations of Mack’s story all inspiration porn fails to attend to the  critical racial context that is necessary to understand the differences between the first and second  waves, despite their similar affective approaches.

" Conclusion: Implications for Black Disability Studies : In closing, I want to broaden these arguments beyond inspiration porn alone. Despite the increasing  amount of work on race and disability, the field of Disability Studies still needs to account for the  ways whiteness informs its foundational theories. We must consider how terms like inspiration  porn, supercrip, narrative prosthesis, compulsory able-bodiedness, misfitting, crip, and so on have  been primarily developed and used with “whiteness as [their] constitutive underpinning.”47  Scholars throughout the field must acknowledge the whiteness of their work explicitly: Say when  the representations in a study are all white and acknowledge when race is not a central analytic.

" Conclusion: Implications for Black Disability Studies : For those of us doing Critical Race Disability Studies and Black Disability studies in particular, I  hope this example of racial differences in the use of inspiration porn frameworks encourages   more scholars to assess and explore how other major theoretical concepts in Disability Studies  might need to be adjusted or even discarded when analyzing racialized experiences and  representations of disability, overall. This is not to say Black Disability Studies needs an entirely  different lexicon, but rather that we should not assume concepts developed in regard to white  experiences and representations of disability manifest in the exact same way among other races,  as I have demonstrated here in regard to inspiration porn. As a result, Critical Race and Black  Disability Studies scholars should feel free to adapt or discard the concepts and theories that don’t  align with the trends and themes we are discovering in our research. This work can draw on the  example of Black Queer Studies and Black Feminist Theory as models for developing new  theories, as well as adapting or critiquing those from the wider fields with which we are in  conversation. Black Disability Studies should always be grounded in the intellectual history and  contemporary conversations of Disability Studies in general, but our work should also never be  confined by how white scholars and activists have previously understood, defined, and delimited  the field. As my analysis of the Black Panther prosthetic viral video indicates, attention to the  nuances of racial context, such as uplift ideology or racially specific terms like Black boy joy, can  and should change our understanding of the representation of disabled subjects. We need Critical  Race approaches to studying the creation, dissemination and impact of inspiration porn and other  Disability Studies concepts and frameworks.
