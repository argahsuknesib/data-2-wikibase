" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : amplifies stereotypes  As a black woman living in the United States, I am always mindful of what others  think about me, and the assumptions they may make. As a black woman with autism, I  am especially aware that colleagues often see me as an ‘angry black woman,’ even  though my thoughts and behaviors are the opposite of this stereotype. (I prefer to label  my ethnicity as black, not African American, because not all black people are African,  and the majority are not American.)  Such cultural stereotypes make it particularly dangerous to be ‘autistic while black.’  Part of the reason people are quick to stereotype me is that there is no research on  middle-aged black women with autism. : ",disability,stereotype,Black women,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : In the workplace, I am often criticized for the way I carry myself. I am told that my  calm, relaxed energy comes off as superior and naive, and that my assertiveness looks  like aggression. When I ask exactly what aggressive behavior I need to tone down,  however, I am told I am doing nothing wrong.   Many people with autism can also appear obstinate or are slow to react in new  situations. When I am inflexible, I am sometimes called unfriendly, insubordinate,  lazy, aggressive or uncontrollable. When I need to process a situation before I respond  to it, some describe my quietness as a ticking bomb that may go off at any time. In  other words, even when I do not validate the negative assumptions people make about  me, they find a way to demonize my compliance.

" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : Because of my autism, I cannot readily change my behavior anyway. For example, I  find it impossible to ‘code switch,’ or change the tone of my voice and mannerisms to fit in with different people. One white female supervisor complained that I should  learn to change my demeanor with different people. I understood what she meant, but  I am socially, emotionally and logically detached from that type of directive to  conform.   My supervisor’s request caused me great anxiety. I worried that I was failing, even  though she described me as ‘90 percent exceeds expectations’ on my yearly  performance review. I could not understand how to change who I am. I just focused  on doing my job while being me. But my supervisor grew bitter and the work  environment became hostile. Eventually, I had to quit.

" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : I would love to run my own business, but being an entrepreneur is not the answer for  most people on the spectrum. Many of us benefit from the routine, stability, social interaction, independence and sense of belonging a job can offer. Until research does  a better job of characterizing autistic black people and stereotypes are rewritten,  employers are missing out on loyal workers who want to do a great job every day.  Bound	by	bias: Within the black community too, many people have tried to hold me to their idea of  how I should behave as a black woman. Other black employees speak to me in a  familiar manner, as if we already have a connection. Their ability to code switch is  amazing. But the thought of putting on a show like that every day overwhelms me.  Most of the time, my energy level does not match theirs.

" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : These differences cause me significant problems with other black women in  particular. They do not relate to me, and as a result, I experience isolation and  sabotage. People reason that black women look out for one another, but that has not  been my experience.   Many black colleagues who want to help warn me that I should be seen and not heard,  or that I should wait until I am spoken to. As a person on the spectrum, I do not  initiate conversation. I am quiet. But due to stereotypes, they too view me according  to their own thoughts and biases. ",disability,stereotype,ableism,Black women,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : After getting my official autism diagnosis at age 46, I turned to the research literature.  I found excellent articles that support and validate my feelings and experiences, but I could find no research on autistic black people.

" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : The doctor who diagnosed me told me not to tell people I have autism because no one  would want to work with me. When I did tell a psychiatrist and a few clinical therapists who are colleagues that I recognize I have autism traits, they instinctively  rejected the idea. “You’re just going through something,” they said.  A	need	to	be	seen: There is a debate in autism research about whether race should be considered in  evaluating how well therapies work. In 2016 ,	 Jason	Travers  and his colleagues  analyzed 408 peer-reviewed, published studies of evidence-based autism treatments.  Only 73 of them, or 17.9 percent,  reported	the	race,	ethnicity	or	nationality  of  participants. Of the nearly 2,500 participants in the 73 studies, fewer than one in five  reported their race — and 63.5 percent of those were white.  Reading this paper was devastating to me. I was overwhelmed by disappointment.  There is little question race can influence the experience and treatment of autism.

" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : Race is seldom reported in autism studies because the condition is often  overlooked	 in	minority	children  and adults. The statistics on	autism maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide no information on race or  ethnicity for autistic adults, although there has been an increase in diagnoses among  minority children. Even so, one in four minority children — most of whom are black  or Hispanic — still  misses	out	on	a	diagnosis .   People often blame low rates of diagnosis and intervention in minority children on the  children’s parents underreporting symptoms or lacking the resources to access expert  care. But this is a stereotype as well: Plenty of minority children  do	not	come	from	 underprivileged	families  nor lack access to healthcare providers and teachers to  screen them for autism.

" ‘Autistic while black’: How autism : To dispel harmful stereotypes, researchers must include and track autistic black  people.
