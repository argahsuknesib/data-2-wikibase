" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : DECEMBER 2, 2016  Dr. Maya Angelou once said, “History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be  unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.” I especially think of  this quote after I watch the news to learn of story after story about  unarmed black  persons killed by cops . I watched the videos of their deaths circulate across  social media without a thought of their families or the  PTSD  that would likely  occur from watching one of your loved ones die or be beaten into submission. : ",police violence,Black,social media,anti-Black racism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : When I watched those videos I felt physically ill. I felt like someone I knew and  loved would be next, that it wasn’t a matter of if but  when . I thought that despite  the psychological pain that the videos caused me, it was my duty to be informed.   This all changed when I woke up one week and learned of a new black death  three days in a row. I couldn’t watch anymore; I couldn’t stand to see any more  blood shed or parents crying while reporters pressed microphones in their faces.

" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : I turn to it when everything feels bleak, exhausting, and I feel scared. The truth is  that I am petrified by the thought of living in an America that has chosen time and  time again to not love me or the people who look like me. An America that  favors  whiteness  and anything in proximity to it. An America that favors capitalism and  the idea of the American Dream above the lives of People of Color, of a  school to  prison pipeline  that keeps money in the hands of white elites and black men  behind bars at alarming rates. We live in an America that is continually allowing  the ugliest parts of history to repeat themselves. I stand with the  #NoDAPL  protectors  because I know that the war they are fighting will be hard won, that the  war they are fighting is not unlike the war that I, a black disabled woman, am  fighting.

" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : I have been asking myself for quite some time: Why does history seem to be  repeating itself despite the fact that so many of us marginalized people are facing  it with courage and resistance? As I watch the  Native Resistance  to #NoDAPL  and the water protectors being massed and threatened with  physical violence  in  the same way that  protesters of police brutality  against unarmed black women,  men, and children are, I am reminded of the fact that we still have so much more  to do. The burden is often on us to fight for our own communities and focus on  the issues specific to us. And while I absolutely understand the importance of  fighting for your own communities and working toward solutions that will help  your individual communities prosper, I believe that as marginalized communities  we are stronger when we stand together.

" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : In the face of an uncertain future under a Donald Trump presidency, I am  completely with the #NODAPL protectors as they fight for their right to not only  water, but their right to keep their land sacred and free of a pipeline that  threatens their lives and livelihood. An oil pipeline that the  protectors  say  threatens their public health, welfare, and cultural resources. After the  events of  Sunday, November 21st, the protectors faced increased violence from police.  ",#NoDAPL,environmental racism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : There were  water cannons  used on them in freezing temperatures and tear gas.   However, I know that just because I am in full support of the protectors that their  story is not mine to tell. In fact, my only job is to share the voices and work of  Native people and I work hard to do so. ",stories,cross-solidarity,police violence,protest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : I often visit the website  StandingRock.Net  for the latest news and updates and  the Twitter timeline of Dr. Adrienne Keene who updates their blog “Native  Appropriations” with resources, photos, and other materials. Keene was recently  on the  BuzzFeed  podcast  Another Round  where they spoke of the conditions and  the way it feels to watch live streams of the people they know and love being  pepper sprayed and harmed. Hearing Keene speak about this reminded me of  the way I feel when I read about another black person’s murder, the anger and  exhaustion of knowing that they won’t be the last, the frustration in knowing that I  cannot physically be at these protests. I know that my body is not strong enough  to attend the protests and that I am not mentally and emotionally strong enough  to attend these protests. I feel like I am not doing enough by tweeting and writing  words about the way I feel in this current climate. I try my best to remind myself  that quelling my voice helps no one. I believe the same can be said for the voices  of the #NoDAPL protectors.  ",education,environmental racism,protest,diability,cross-solidarity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How I Relate to the DAPL Protests as a : Black Woman : ""I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one."" : We cannot let this fall to the wayside and treat it as if it is a passing occurrence. It  takes courage to protest violence in the face of a country that [elected a man that  the KKK endorsed] (http://www.teenvogue.com/story/donald-trump-endorsed- kkk-newspaper-protests-dillard-university-david-duke). It took courage to push  back against the aforementioned violence and unequal rights put upon the  leaders involved in the Civil Rights Movement. We have made progress, but  we’ve got an even longer way to go. I do not want to end up on the side of history  that belittled both the Black Lives Matter protests and the #NoDAPL protectors  when all we are fighting for is the right to live and prosper. The human rights that  are supposed to be everyone’s— not just the white and elite. I stand with the  protectors and the Black Lives Matter activists because we are simply stronger  together. History cannot be unlived; we cannot take an eraser to the parts we’d  rather forget, but we can choose to learn from them, to right the wrongs done to  marginalized communities and blocking the Dakota Access Pipeline is a step in  the right direction.
