" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Autism's White Privilege Problem  Morénike Giwa Onaiwu When I—as a black person, as a woman, as an autistic adult, as the mother of black  autistic children, as an advocate—think about the world of autism research and practice,  the words of Doughboy come to mind. In a poignant ending scene from the late African  American director John Singleton's iconic debut film,  Boyz n the Hood , Doughboy sadly  remarks, “Either they don't know, don't show…or don't care about what's going on in the  hood. ” Similarly, when it comes to autism, either they—or should I say you all—do not  know, do not show, or do not care about black, indigenous, people of color (BIPoC) very  much. : ",Black woman,disability,research,BIPOC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Perhaps “they”—society at large, particularly those who are more privileged—are  uninformed of the realities of those whose lives are more laden with oppression than  theirs (“they don't know”). The typical “face” of autism tends to be that of a little white  boy, regardless of autism's actual prevalence in all racial, age, and gender groups.  Moreover, autism continues to be widely depicted and perceived as a tragic childhood  condition that devastates families and burdens communities and, therefore, requires  urgent intervention.   A Google image search for the word “autism” yields a plethora of (mostly white)  children, puzzle pieces, and colorful infographics bearing lists of symptoms, warning  signs, graphs, and statistics. Like these images, the majority of autistic characters in  popular media (e.g.,  Atypical's  Sam,  Parenthood's  Max,  The Good Doctor's  Shaun, and  Big  Bang Theory's  Sheldon) tend to be white and male. They bear little resemblance to  Arnaldo Rios, Reginald “Levi” Latson, JT Torres, Kayleb Moon-Robinson, or David  Ramos—all autistic individuals of color who were unjustly (and in most instances,  violently) mistreated by U.S. police officers.",disability,oppression,racism,police violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : In all of these cases, the intervening officers perceived these individuals' mannerisms  as aggression rather than characteristics of autism and responded with excessive  force. Although the officers' actions are clearly reprehensible, it begs the question: with  such little recognition that autistic people of color even exist, should we truly be  shocked by any of these incidents? Or by the recent deaths of Eyad Hallaq of Jerusalem  or Elijah McCain of Colorado, both young men of color who displayed autistic  characteristics and were killed by the police? In contrast to the limited perspective on autism shared by the general public, there are a  significant number of individuals (and their respective organizations/institutions) who  actually possess an understanding that grave inequities exist in communities of color  with regard to autism. ",police violence,compliance,disability,killed,BIPOC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: :  Although the layperson might be largely uninformed, autism  professionals and experts, including clinicians, investigators, service providers, and  others who are privy to more in-depth information, cannot feign such ignorance; they  “know” about it.   However, what they know is rarely, if ever, applied in a manner that could result in  meaningful change to the disparities faced by people of color in the autism community.  If knowledge is “power,” in this case that power is rendered dormant. These are the  individuals and institutions within the autism community who “don't show.” They do not  adequately show what is going on with regard to the diagnostic, access, outcome,  educational, psychosocial, economic, and other gaps between races. ",disability,BIPOC,power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : This failure to call attention to and/or take action to right these imbalances is not  necessarily malicious. Usually, it is not intentionally racist; in fact, most likely it seldom  is. What it is, however, is self-serving. It is comfortable; it is familiar. It is lazy. And it is  cowardly. For it is a lot safer to maintain the status quo, to “go with the flow” and to  pretend not to notice. It takes courage and integrity to have to initiate difficult  conversations. It takes time, and energy, and resources to make the efforts required to  transform our spaces, our policies, and our practices to make them more inclusive. It  takes self-awareness and strength to yield one's privilege: to ask hard questions, to  make space for others, to work toward restoration, and to unlearn and re-educate  ourselves. Sadly, despite awareness of the plight of people of color in the autism  community, many would rather not inconvenience themselves.

" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : In addition to those who “don't know” and those who know, but “don't show,” there is,  according to a more pessimistic hypothesis, a third possibility: those who simply “don't  care.” Like those who “don't show,” those in society who “don't care” are indeed aware  of these issues. However, since personally they are not very impacted by these  marginalizations, they largely disregard them. These very real discrepancies remain  intentionally unaddressed because it is of little interest to them and because they see  little to no benefit in getting involved. Essentially, “don't show” and “don't care” reside on  a continuum. If you spend enough time as one who does not show, you will eventually  evolve into someone who does not care.

" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Having read this, how are you feeling right now? Pretty crappy, I would assume. When  racism within the autism community is brought up, it evokes a sense of discomfort so  thick it is nearly tangible. White people seem to feel especially awkward about this  topic. And I get that it is not exactly pleasant to think or talk about it. However, can you  imagine what living it is like? I can, because unlike many of you, I do not have a choice. ",racism,disability,white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : It is uncomfortable for me too. Sometimes (often) I feel as reluctant as Doughboy did to  have to face that hurtful and ugly reality. I desperately want to believe that the structural  racism within the collective world of autism, in both its subtle and more blatant  manifestations, is merely a figment of my imagination (an imagination some would  allege is essentially “nonexistent” since I am autistic). I would like nothing more than to  feel assured that BIPoC autistic peers are valued as much as we seem to be in all of the  rhapsodic and carefully curated “solidarity” and “Black Lives Matter” statements that  have been issued in recent months. I wish the amalgamation of both the subjective  (observations, personal experiences, and anecdotes from autistic BIPoC peers) and  objective (“evidence-informed”) data did not collectively paint the same dismal picture  of inequity. But wishing something does not make it true.  ",structural,disability,BIPOC,solidarity,Black Lives Matter,data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : In  Boyz in the Hood , neither Doughboy nor his brother Ricky lived long enough to have a  fighting chance to change their circumstances. Their opportunity to experience better in  this life ceased the moment their hearts ceased to beat. But if you are reading this, your  heart, like mine, beats on. That means that we still have a chance to transform even this  chaotic mess into something new that we can build together. It might seem amorphous,  intimidating, maybe even impossible, but we must push past fear, doubt, ignorance,  apathy, or whatever the obstacle is and seize the opportunity.  ",transformation,care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : The problem is an enormous one; I am not going to lie to you nor myself about its  scope. But present circumstances do not have to determine the final outcome. I believe  that gradual progress is the ancestor of monumental change, and it starts with you and  me. It starts today. I ask you, allies, families, fellow autistic people,  etc.  of all ages,  genders, races, and backgrounds, to pledge to take the following steps toward a world  where when it comes to autism and race: You will commit to doing the work to know  what is happening. You will make concerted efforts to show these important concepts  to others so they can be more informed. And, last but not least, through practical and  consistent action, you will show that you do, indeed, care.  ",scope,family,disability,race,care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : First, strive to continuously increase your knowledge of matters relevant to autism and  race. A great way to start is by reading the intriguing roundtable discussion, moderated  by a black autism researcher, in this issue of  Autism in Adulthood . The discussion  features several autistic and nonautistic panelists with diverse racial and ethnic  backgrounds (Latinx, black, indigenous, and Pacific Islander) who create a thought- provoking dialogue about structural racism in autism research and practice.   In addition,  you can follow BIPoC autism activists on social media; read the landmark autism and  race anthology,  All the Weight of Our Dreams: On Living Racialized Autism ; or support  efforts such as the grassroots Autistic People of Color Fund,* which provides material  support in the form of microgrants for those in need.

" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Second, plant seeds of change. Are you a clinician, researcher, or a service provider  seeking to serve a more diverse population? First, assess yourself, is your environment  one that would be welcoming to and inclusive of such individuals? Your board? Your  staff? If not, fix that first. Then seek out some strategic partnerships with minority  serving institutions, professional and community organizations, multicultural fraternities  and sororities (the Divine Nine, the National Association of Latino Fraternal  Organizations [NALFO],  etc. ), faith-based institutions, and so on.  ",inclusion,organizations,institution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Mentoring others is another way to plant seeds of change. There is a critical need for  greater racial diversity in autism research and practice; one way to help facilitate this is  to increase the amount of BIPoC researchers and providers. To do so, we must ensure  that we diversify our student population. One notable example, LoneStar Leadership  Education In Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (LEND), places strong  emphasis on the inclusion of racial and ethnic diversity as well as individuals with  disabilities, including autism, among both its faculty and trainees; typically 50% or more  of their annual fellows are people of color. By doing so, this interdisciplinary autism and  neurodevelopmental training program in Texas is making tremendous progress toward  its mission to develop and equip leaders to serve under-represented groups.

" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Third, use your privilege for good. All human beings have different identities, some that  are more privileged in specific circumstances and some that are more marginalized. Do  not get defensive about having privilege. Instead, flip it! If you have some influence in a  certain sphere, take advantage of it. Use your position to share the ideologies and  perspectives of those who are not as likely to have such a platform. Or share the  platform. Or yield it to someone else! Do you  really  need to be the one to give that  address or that interview, just because you were the one who was invited? And if so,  who can you bring along who might be able to benefit from being present? Is there a  person of color, or even better—an autistic person of color—with whom you can  collaborate?  Fourth, do “what is right, not what is easy” with regard to autism research and practice.  If you are a practitioner, perhaps you can find ways to accept new types of payment  (e.g., other types of insurance, payment plans, and sliding scale fees)? Maybe you need  to hire additional staff who are multilingual? Offer nontraditional hours of operation  (some nights, some weekends,  etc. )? If you are in research, perhaps you can also  establish quotas to ensure your studies include participants of color. That might mean  that it takes more time and effort to recruit, enroll, and retain study participants, but it  will be worth the effort. Consider advocating for more diverse data sets. There is no rule  that says you  must  use that same old tired sample wherein the vast majority of  participants are white—even if that sample is “normed” or affiliated with some  impressive entity.

" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Lastly, not only “bloom where you're planted,” but try to blaze a trail! A positive example  is  Autism in Adulthood . Rather than follow a “tried and true” template, this journal has  taken quite a number of risks to remain true to its vision. And though, like everything in  life, it is imperfect, I believe it has purposefully positioned itself to be an effective tool in  our collaborative quest for racial equity in autism research and practice. From its  carefully selected leadership team of autistic and nonautistic editors, its stance on the  use of respectful nonstigmatizing language, its requirement for substantive plain  language lay summaries, its use of traditional and community reviewers, and the  purposeful composition of its editorial board (of which I am a proud member),  Autism in  Adulthoods's  commitment to meaningful inclusion is far from lip service.

" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: :  Believing  diversity is not something that should be relegated to a “special interest” or ad-hoc  group, our eclectic editorial board, consisting of advocates, researchers, clinicians, and  community leaders, represents a diverse range of neurotypes, races, gender identities,  nationalities, disciplines, ages, and organizations. We engage in open honest dialogue  with one another, even when it is hard. In doing so, we continuously learn from one  another, foster a sense of mutual respect and understanding, stimulate ideas for future  research and exploration, and help build a forum for deep meaningful discussions on  the issues that matter most to autistic adults.  ",research,disability,diversity,organizations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" “They Don't Know, Don't Show, or Don't Care”: : Whoever you are and whatever you do, you can affect change right where you are. You  can know, you can show, and you can care. It will require some innovation and some  patience on your part, but it can be done. Seek opportunities to make progress, even if  seemingly small or unconventional. There are so many possibilities!
