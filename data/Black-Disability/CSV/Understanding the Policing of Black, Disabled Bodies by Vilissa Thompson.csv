" Understanding the Policing of Black, : Freddie Gray, Laquan MacDonald, Kevin Matthews, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner,  Charleena Lyles, Sandra Bland, Quintonio LeGrier, Stephon Watts, Korryn Gaines,  Natasha McKenna, Eric Smith, and Daniel Prude are all Black, disabled victims of  state violence. In the United States, 50 percent of people killed by law enforcement  are disabled, and  more than half of disabled African Americans  have been arrested  by the time they turn 28—double the risk in comparison to their white disabled  counterparts. While these statistics provide basic insight into how law enforcement  engage with parts of the disability community, much remains unknown. Specifically,  the United States must improve the mechanisms used for data collection on police  encounters to provide an accurate, complete picture of these long-standing  dynamics and misuse of force. In the ongoing efforts and discussion surrounding  police reform and the need for shifting investments into different types of  interventions, policymakers need to have solid data in order to refute messaging  that minimizes the magnitude of the problem.

" History of policing Black disabled people in the United States : Racism and ableism have been intimately woven into the fabric of this country since  enslaved people first arrived on the shores of this stolen land. Throughout the 19th  century,  phrenology —the debunked science claiming human nature could be  traced to or understood by the shape of one’s skull—served as a basis for the  justification for slavery. Around the same time, American society began to construct  a medical model that framed disabled people as broken and reliant on nondisabled  people’s so-called charity and expertise. If a person was deemed “unfixable,” they  were shunned by society and commonly faced three fates:  abandonment,  concealment by their family, or institutionalization . : ",racism,ableism,history,policing,United States ,medical model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" History of policing Black disabled people in the United States : In the context of slavery, this dangerous theory tied a slave’s economic value to  their physical ability and productivity. Yet due to the brutal and inhumane nature of  slavery, enslaved people were often punished by their owners with disability or  disfigurement, either to prevent them from running away or discourage behaviors  that slaveholders considered defiant. At the time, even a slave’s urge to escape was  pathologized; for example, the term “ drapetomania ” was used to describe a mental  illness that led them to run away or rebel.

" History of policing Black disabled people in the United States : More than a century after the abolition of slavery, so-called  Ugly Laws  were born in  the post-Civil War Bay Area—a place now heralded as the home of  the  disability rights  and  disability justice  movements. These laws were intended to  keep individuals deemed “diseased, maimed, mutilated, and any way deformed, so  as to be an unsightly or disgusting object” out of public view. Many of these  individuals were also poor. The nexus of  poverty, racism, and ableism  was  instrumental in the rise of institutions and sanitariums, which were designed to  keep so-called undesirables out of sight. Though this nation likes to think of its  treatment and acceptance of people with disabilities as ahead of the curve, it is  clear that ableism and racism, among other prejudices, leave legacies that must be  addressed. Lawmakers must understand the issues of the past when designing  policy remedies to meet present-day needs.

" The intertwining of racism and ableism in policing today : As outlined in a 2016 Center for American Progress report, “ Disabled Behind Bars:  The Mass Incarceration of People With Disabilities in America’s Jails and Prisons ,”  the relatively recent shift toward community-based services and  deinstitutionalization with little funding has resulted in the significant uptick of the  number of disabled people incarcerated in jails and prisons. There has also been  growing support to return to the days of warehousing disabled people.  Cook  County Jail , for example, is often inaccurately described as the largest provider of  mental health services, when in reality it is an institution. It  warehouses vulnerable  people , lacking the staffing capacity, facilities, or expertise to appropriately treat  people experiencing mental health crises.  As recently as December 2019 , President  Donald Trump actively advocated for the reinvestment of large-scale psychiatric  institutions. : ",disabled,incarceration,deinstitutionalization,institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The intertwining of racism and ableism in policing today : The uptick in the number of incarcerated people with disabilities is intrinsically tied  to race, as  structural racism —and its effects on health care, poverty, and inequality,  among other areas—contributes to a  greater percentage of disabled people  within  the Black community than in the general population. Similarly, racism and ableism  remain closely intertwined in ongoing conversations tied to police violence. The  government  autopsy report  for George Floyd, for example, highlighted that Floyd  had “underlying conditions” including hypertension and a previous COVID-19  diagnosis. Following media reports on this information, some began to believe  the  inaccurate narrative  that Floyd’s disability—as opposed to the officer’s knee on  his neck—caused his death. This is a common tactic found in the wake of state  violence, such as police officers blaming a  Deaf man for not hearing an order to  stop  or assuming that an individual who is  having a seizure  has engaged in  substance misuse. Either way, a person ends up dead—but the presence of a  disability falsely paints their death as excusable.

" The false portrayal of disability as a threat to law enforcement : Prioritizing and demanding compliance has always hindered law enforcement’s  ability to recognize a person’s disability over the course of an interaction. These  misunderstandings can have traumatic, even deadly, consequences. For example, a  police officer’s failure to consider someone’s disability can lead to escalation or the  use of excessive force, such as unnecessarily using pepper spray, tasing, or  initiating an arrest. Depending on the type of disability a person has, officers can  misread their ability or willingness to comply, which in many cases leads them to  respond with inappropriate tactics. : ",compliance,police,disability,police violence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The false portrayal of disability as a threat to law enforcement : For instance, a person’s inability to hear and react appropriately to an officer’s  commands can be misread as the person being difficult. Those with an awkward  gait pattern due to cerebral palsy can be erroneously thought of as being under the  influence and subjected to questioning or arrest. Autistic people who are not able  to maintain eye contact or repeat the statements given to them may be perceived  as displaying hostile or uncooperative behaviors. Individuals in mental or physical  crisis who are unable to communicate clearly or express themselves may be read  as threatening or lacking self-control and, subsequently, may experience  unnecessary force because they cannot understand or follow an officer’s orders.  ",compliance,police violence,disability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The false portrayal of disability as a threat to law enforcement : Law enforcement’s tendency and desire to control all variables in a situation can  have devastating effects in situations where an individual may be struggling to  communicate or respond due to their disability, whether physical, psychological, or  otherwise. As a result, many disabled people fear the police because any  encounter, regardless of how routine or perfunctory, could result in death. Law  enforcement’s lack of awareness and ability to see a person holistically has been  the inspiration behind the  growth of disability-centered trainings  within police  departments over the past decade. However, standards for these trainings are not  consistent in terms of curriculum, frequency, or who is qualified to conduct them.  ",disability,police,police violence,killed,trainings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The false portrayal of disability as a threat to law enforcement : In addition to the use of excessive force, law enforcement have also been shown to  remove or deny certain accommodations, such as a cane or wheelchair, related to  individuals’ disabilities. While this may be framed by law enforcement as a safety  measure, the reality is that eliminating a person’s ability to move or communicate is  a clear violation of their basic human rights. Many of the accommodations or  supports that are removed are essential for a person’s ability to move or walk—as  with  crutches ,  wheelchairs , and  prosthetics —or their ability to communicate, such  as through a  sign language interpreter  or communication device.

" Opportunities for more inclusive data collection : While the  Washington Post  and  other sources  track data on policing that include  disability, there remain huge gaps in the availability of data that provide a  breakdown by disability type. Current data also do not allow cross-referencing of  race and disability, so while it may be possible to determine how many Black  people and disabled people are killed by law enforcement, it is not possible to  easily determine how many Black Deaf people are victims. Current data collection  must be aggregated across race, gender, and disability status to give a more  complete picture of this issue. : ",inclusive data collection,disability,race,Black,killed,police,gender,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Opportunities for more inclusive data collection : Furthermore, while police training is often seen as a quick fix or effective public  relations response, there is little information available about what makes such a  training effective. There is a need for greater evaluation and data collection— specifically through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented  Policing Services and Bureau of Justice Statistics—tied to consistent standards for  these trainings across the country.  ",police,training,data collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Opportunities for more inclusive data collection : Additionally, while in custody, disabled people are often denied access to  reasonable accommodations, which can include  access to sign language  interpreters  or  wheelchairs they depend on for safety and mobility . In especially  horrifying scenarios, others have had  their caregivers injured or killed .  Documentation of instances where law enforcement denied access to tools that  help people communicate or keep them safe and alive is critical for accountability.  If an individual is shot because they did not respond to law enforcement, and it is  later discovered that the person’s communication board was confiscated, then this  is a case of a deliberate action to deny a person’s fundamental rights. There must  be consistent data collection on law enforcement’s removal or denial of reasonable  accommodations for people with disabilities.  ",custody,disabled people,reasonable accomodations,denial,police,data collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Opportunities for more inclusive data collection : Finally, while a new  federal requirement  obligates law enforcement to track cases  of people who die in custody, they must expand this documentation to include  disabilities acquired in custody due to excessive force. The growing number of  people who have become blind as a result of being  shot with rubber bullets ,  acquired  brain injuries  as a result of violence, or become  paralyzed  makes these  critical rectifications even more urgent. Data collection must include information on  people who have suffered severe physical, mental, or psychological harm while in  custody, including disabilities acquired by misuse of force.  ",police,police violence,disablement,custody,data collection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Conclusion : While the case for significant policing reforms is a strong one, much of mainstream  society underestimates the pervasiveness of the misuse of force is as it relates to  people with disabilities. Similarly, many vastly underestimate the size of the  disability community, which includes more than  61 million people  in  1 out of 3 U.S.  households . Particularly important is the intersection of race and disability:  According to data from 2017,  1 in 4 Black adults  in the United States have a  disability. :  Data collection is critical to pushing back on false narratives that minimize the  problem of how law enforcement treat and respond to people with disabilities,  particularly those who are Black. Understanding the scope and nuances of policing  Black disabled bodies is necessary to craft solutions that will help undo the  centuries of aggression, violence, and denial of rights that have wrongfully led to  the trauma and deaths of far too many individuals.
